Many of these lectures are based on the original notes by Y. R. Gel and C. Cutler for the course STAT-443 Forecasting (University of Waterloo, Canada) adapted and expanded by V. Lyubchich for the course MEES-713 Environmental Statistics 2 (University of Maryland, USA).\nEach lecture starts by listing the learning objectives and required reading materials, with additional references in the text. The notes introduce the methods and give a few examples but are less detailed than the reading materials. The notes do not substitute a textbook.\nThe audience is expected to be familiar with R programming and the following statistical concepts and methods: probability distributions, sampling inference and hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression analysis (including simple and multiple linear regression, mixed-effects models, generalized linear models, and generalized additive models)."

    "text": "1.1 Diagnostics for the simple linear regression: residual analysis\nGiven a simple linear regression (SLR) model \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X_{t} + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\] where \\(Y_{t}\\) is the dependent variable and \\(X_{t}\\) is the regressor (independent, predictor) variable, \\(t = 1,\\dots,n\\), and \\(n\\) is the sample size.\nThe Gauss–Markov theorem\nIf \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are uncorrelated random variables with common variance, then of all possible estimators \\(\\beta^{\\ast}_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta^{\\ast}_{1}\\) that are linear functions of \\(Y_{t}\\), the least squares estimators have the smallest variance.\nThus, the ordinary least squares (OLS) assumptions are:\n\nthe residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) have common variance (\\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are homoskedastic);\n\nthe residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are uncorrelated;\nto provide prediction intervals (PIs), confidence intervals (CIs), and to test hypotheses about the parameters in our model, we also need to assume that\n\nthe residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are normally distributed (\\(\\epsilon_{t} \\sim N (0, \\sigma^{ 2} )\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the residuals are independent and identically distributed and normal (\\(\\epsilon_{t} \\sim\\) i.i.d. \\(N(0, \\sigma^{2}\\))), then all three above properties are automatically satisfied. In this case, \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are not only uncorrelated but are independent. To be independent is a much stronger property than to be uncorrelated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile a given model may still have useful predictive value even when the OLS assumptions are violated, the confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and \\(p\\)-values associated with the \\(t\\)-statistics will generally be incorrect when the OLS assumptions do not hold.\n\n\nA basic technique for investigating the aptness of a regression model is based on analyzing the residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\). In a residual analysis, we attempt to assess the validity of the OLS assumptions by examining the estimated residuals \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{1}, \\dots, \\hat{\\epsilon}_{n}\\) to see if they satisfy the imposed conditions. If the model is apt, the observed residuals should reflect the assumptions listed above.\nWe perform our diagnostics analysis from a step-by-step verification of each assumption. We start with visual diagnostics, then proceed with formal tests. A lot of useful diagnostic information may be obtained from a residual plot.\n\n1.1.1 Homoskedasticity\nWe plot the residuals \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) vs. time, fitted values \\(\\hat{Y}_{t}\\), and predictor values \\(X_t\\). If the assumption of constant variance is satisfied, \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) fluctuate around the zero mean with more or less constant amplitude and this amplitude does not change with time, fitted values \\(\\hat{Y}_{t}\\), and predictor values \\(X_t\\).\nIf the (linear) model is not appropriate, the mean of the residuals may be non-constant, i.e., not always 0. Figure 1.1 shows an example of a random pattern that we would like the residuals to have (no systematic patterns).\n\nCodeset.seed(1)\nn = 26; m = 0; s = 522\nx <- ts(rnorm(n, mean = m, sd = s))\nforecast::autoplot(x) + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 4) +\n    theme_light()\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A time series plot of ‘ideal’ residuals. These residuals \\(x_t\\) are simulated i.i.d. normal.\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we notice in a residual plot?\n\nChange of variability with time indicates heterogeneity of variance of the residuals.\nObvious lack of symmetry (around 0) in the plot suggests a lack of normality or presence of outliers.\nSystematic trends in the residuals suggest correlations between the residuals or inadequateness of the proposed model.\n\nSometimes it is possible to transform the dependent or independent variables to remedy these problems, i.e., to get rid of the correlated residuals or to stabilize the variance (see Appendix A and Appendix B). Otherwise, we need to change (re-specify) the model.\nA useful technique that can guide us in this process is to plot \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) vs. \\(\\hat{Y}_{t}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) vs. each predictor \\(X_t\\). Similarly to their time series plot, \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) should fluctuate around the zero mean with more or less constant amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher shipments model and patterns in residuals\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 shows the R code and residuals of a simple linear regression exploring dishwasher shipments (DISH) and private residential investments (RES) for several years.\nHow different are the patterns in Figure 1.2 from those in Figure 1.1?\n\nCodeD <- read.delim(\"./data/dish.txt\") %>% \n    rename(Year = YEAR)\nmod1 <- lm(DISH ~ RES, data = D)\np1 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = Year, y = mod1$residuals)) + \n    geom_line() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 4) + \n    ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = mod1$fitted.values, y = mod1$residuals)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 4) + \n    xlab(\"Fitted values\") +\n    ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = RES, y = mod1$residuals)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 4) + \n    xlab(\"Residential investments (RES)\") +\n    ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 + p3 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Estimated residuals plotted vs. time, fitted values, and predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Uncorrelatedness\nIt is a deep topic that we shall discuss many times in different variations in the future. When observations are obtained in a time sequence (the topic of time series analysis and our course), there is a high possibility that the errors \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are correlated. For instance, if the residual is positive (or negative) for a given day \\(t\\), it is likely that the residual for the following day \\(t+1\\) is also positive (or negative). Such residuals are said to be autocorrelated (i.e., serially correlated). Autocorrelation of many environmental time series is positive.\nWhen the residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are related over time, a model for the residuals frequently employed is the first-order autoregressive model, i.e., the AR(1) model.\nThe autoregressive model of the first order, AR(1), is defined as \\[\n\\epsilon_{t} = \\rho \\epsilon_{t - 1} + u_{t},\n\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the autoregression coefficient (\\(- 1 < \\rho < 1\\)) and \\(u_{t}\\) is an uncorrelated \\(N (0, \\sigma^{2})\\) time series.\nThe model assumes that the residual \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) at the time \\(t\\) contains a component resulting from the residual \\(\\epsilon_{t - 1}\\) at the time \\(t - 1\\) and a random disturbance \\(u_{t}\\) that is independent of the earlier periods.\nEffects of autocorrelation\nIf the OLS method is employed for the parameter estimation and the residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are autocorrelated of the first order, then the consequences are:\n\nThe OLS estimators will still be unbiased, but they no longer have the minimum variance property (see the Gauss–Markov theorem); they tend to be relatively inefficient.\nThe residual mean square error (MSE) can seriously underestimate the true variance of the error terms in the model.\nStandard procedures for CI, PI, and tests using the \\(F\\) and Student’s \\(t\\) distributions are no longer strictly applicable.\n\nFor example, see Section 5.2 in Chatterjee and Simonoff (2013) for more details.\nDurbin–Watson test\nA widely used test for examining whether the residuals in a regression model are correlated is the Durbin–Watson test. This test is based on the AR(1) model for \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\). The one-tail test alternatives are \\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_{0}{:} ~ \\rho = 0 & ~~ vs. ~~ H_{1}{:} ~ \\rho > 0,\\\\\nH_{0}{:} ~ \\rho = 0 & ~~ vs. ~~ H_{1}{:} ~ \\rho < 0,\n\\end{align}\n\\] and the two-tail test is \\[\nH_{0}{:} ~ \\rho = 0 ~~ vs. ~~ H_{1}{:} ~ \\rho \\neq 0.\\\\\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen dealing with real data, positive autocorrelation is usually the case.\n\n\nThe Durbin–Watson test statistic DW is based on the differences between the adjacent residuals, \\(\\epsilon_{t} - \\epsilon_{t - 1}\\), and is of the following form: \\[\n\\text{DW} = \\frac{\\sum^{n}_{t = 2} \\left( \\epsilon_{t} - \\epsilon_{t - 1} \\right)^{2}}{\\sum^{n}_{t = 1} \\epsilon^{2}_{t}},\n\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) is the regression residual at the time \\(t\\) and \\(n\\) is the number of observations.\nThe DW statistic takes on values in the range \\([0, 4]\\). In fact,\n\nWhen \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are positively correlated, adjacent residuals tend to be of similar magnitude so that the numerator of DW will be relatively small or 0.\nWhen \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are negatively correlated, adjacent residuals tend to be of similar magnitude but with the opposite sign so that the numerator of DW will be relatively large or equal to 4.\n\nHence, low DW corresponds to positive autocorrelation. Values of DW that tend towards 4 are in the region for negative autocorrelation.\nThe exact action limit for the Durbin–Watson test is difficult to calculate. Hence, the test is used with a lower bound \\(d_{L}\\) and an upper bound \\(d_{U}\\). We may use Table 1.1 as a rule of thumb.\n\n\nTable 1.1: Regions of rejection of the null hypothesis for the Durbin–Watson test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom 0 to \\(d_{L}\\)\n\nfrom \\(d_{L}\\) to \\(d_{U}\\)\n\nfrom \\(d_{U}\\) to \\(4 - d_{U}\\)\n\nfrom \\(4 - d_{U}\\) to \\(4 - d_{L}\\)\n\nfrom \\(4 - d_{L}\\) to 4\n\n\nReject \\(H_{0}\\), positive autocorrelation\nNeither accept \\(H_{1}\\) or reject \\(H_{0}\\)\n\nDo not reject \\(H_{0}\\)\n\nNeither accept \\(H_{1}\\) or reject \\(H_{0}\\)\n\nReject \\(H_{0}\\), negative autocorrelation\n\n\n\nThe critical values \\(d_{L}\\) and \\(d_{U}\\) have been tabulated for combinations of various sample sizes, significance levels, and number of regressors in a model. For large samples, a normal approximation can be used (Chatterjee and Simonoff 2013): \\[\nz = \\left(\\frac{\\text{DW}}{2} - 1 \\right)\\sqrt{n}.\n\\] Statistical software packages usually provide exact \\(p\\)-values based on the null distribution of the test statistic (a linear combination of \\(\\chi^2\\) variables).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher residuals DW test\n\n\n\nApply the Durbin–Watson test to the residuals from the dishwashers example, i.e., DISH vs. RES, using the R package lmtest.\n\nlmtest::dwtest(D$DISH ~ D$RES, alternative = \"greater\")\n\n#> \n#>  Durbin-Watson test\n#> \n#> data:  D$DISH ~ D$RES\n#> DW = 0.6, p-value = 3e-06\n#> alternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is greater than 0\n\n\nBased on the low \\(p\\)-value we can reject the \\(H_{0}\\): \\(\\rho = 0\\) at the 95% confidence level and accept the alternative \\(H_{1}\\): \\(\\rho > 0\\).\n\n\nRuns test\nDepartures of randomness can take so many forms that no single test for randomness is best for all situations. For instance, one of the most common departures from randomness is the tendency of a sequence to persist in its direction of movement.\nWe can count the number of times a sequence of observations crossed a cut-off line, for example, the median line, and use this information to assess the randomness of \\(\\epsilon_t\\). Alternatively, we count successions of positive or negative differences (see Section 1.4 on the difference sign test). Each such succession is called a run.\nThe formal test is the following. When a sequence of \\(N\\) observations with \\(n\\) observations in positive runs and \\(m\\) observations in negative runs is a random process with independent values generated from a continuous distribution, then the sampling distribution of the number of runs \\(R\\) has the mean and variance \\[\n\\mathrm{E}(R) = \\frac{1 + 2nm}{N}, \\qquad \\sigma^2(R) = \\frac{2nm(2nm-n-m)}{N^2(N-1)},\n\\] where \\(N = n + m\\) is the total sample size.\nThe only assumption for this test is that all sample observations come from a continuous distribution.\nThe two-tail alternative is as follows\n\n\n\\(H_{0}\\): Sequence is generated by a random process;\n\n\\(H_{1}\\): Sequence is generated by a process containing either persistence or frequent changes in direction.\n\nWhen positive autocorrelation (or persistence) is present, \\(R\\) will be small. On the other hand, if the process involves frequent changes in direction (negative autocorrelation or anti-persistence), \\(R\\) will be too large.\nWhen the number of observations is sufficiently large, i.e., \\(N > 30\\), the runs test statistic \\(R\\) is based on the standardized normal test statistic \\[\nz = \\frac{R - \\mathrm{E}(R)}{ \\sigma(R)}.\n\\] Here \\(z\\) follows approximately a standard normal distribution.\nRuns test is easy to interpret. Runs test allows assessing only the first-order serial correlation in the residuals, i.e., to test whether two residuals that are one lag apart are correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher residuals runs test\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nlawstat::runs.test(x, plot.it = TRUE)\n\n#> \n#>  Runs Test - Two sided\n#> \n#> data:  x\n#> Standardized Runs Statistic = -0.4, p-value = 0.7\n\nlawstat::runs.test(mod1$residuals, plot.it = TRUE)\n\n#> \n#>  Runs Test - Two sided\n#> \n#> data:  mod1$residuals\n#> Standardized Runs Statistic = -3, p-value = 0.005\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Runs tests and plots of independent normally distributed simulations \\(x_t\\) and the DISH residuals.\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(p\\)-value for the runs test for the residuals is very low (Figure 1.3), which supports the findings of the DW test that residuals are first-order serially correlated.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Normality\nThere are two major ways of checking normality. Graphical methods visualize differences between empirical data and theoretical normal distribution. Numerical methods conduct statistical tests on the null hypothesis that the variable is normally distributed.\n\n1.1.3.1 Graphical methods\nGraphical methods visualize the data using graphs, such as histograms, stem-and-leaf plots, box plots, etc. For example, Figure 1.4 shows a histogram of the simulated normally distributed data and the residuals from the dishwasher example with superimposed normal curves with the corresponding mean and standard deviation.\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x), aes(x = x)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), binwidth = 300, fill = \"grey50\") +\n    stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                  args = list(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)),\n                  col = 1, lwd = 1.5) +\n    ylab(\"Density\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Random normal values\") + \n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(x, aes(x = mod1$residuals)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), binwidth = 300, fill = \"grey50\") +\n    stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                  args = list(mean = mean(mod1$residuals), sd = sd(mod1$residuals)),\n                  col = 1, lwd = 1.5) +\n    ylab(\"Density\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Model residuals\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Histograms of the simulated normally distributed values and estimated regression residuals.\n\n\n\n\nAnother very popular graphical method of assessing normality is the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot. The Q-Q plot compares the ordered values of a variable with the corresponding ordered values of the normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nQ-Q plots can also be used to compare sample quantiles with quantiles of other, not normal, distribution (e.g., \\(t\\) or gamma distribution), or to compare quantiles of two samples (to assess if both samples come from the same, unspecified, distribution).\n\n\nLet \\(X\\) be a random variable having the property that the equation \\[\n\\Pr \\left( X \\leqslant x \\right) = \\alpha\n\\] has a unique solution \\(x = x_{(\\alpha)}\\) for each \\(0 < \\alpha < 1\\). That is, there exists \\(x_{(\\alpha)}\\) such that \\[\n\\Pr \\left( X \\leqslant x_{(\\alpha)} \\right) = \\alpha\n\\tag{1.1}\\] and no other value of \\(x\\) satisfies Equation 1.1. Then we will call \\(x_{(\\alpha)}\\) the \\(\\alpha\\)th (population) quantile of \\(X\\). Note that any normal distribution has this uniqueness property. If we consider a standard normal \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\), then some well-known quantiles are:\n\n\n\\(z_{(0.5)} = 0\\) (the median), qnorm(0.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n\n\\(z_{(0.05)} = -1.645\\) and \\(z_{(0.95)} = 1.645\\)\n\n\n\\(z_{(0.025)} = -1.96\\) and \\(z_{(0.975)} = 1.96\\)\n\n\nWe call the 0.25th, 0.5th, 0.75th quantiles the first, the second, and the third quartiles, respectively. The quartiles divide our data into 4 equal parts.\nNow suppose \\(X \\sim N (\\mu, \\sigma^{2})\\). By standardizing to \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\), we obtain \\[\n\\alpha = \\Pr \\left( X \\leqslant x_{(\\alpha)} \\right) = \\Pr \\left( \\frac{X - \\mu}{ \\sigma} \\leqslant \\frac{x_{(\\alpha)} - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) = \\Pr \\left( Z \\leqslant \\frac{x_{(\\alpha)} - \\mu}{ \\sigma} \\right) .\n\\]\nWe also have \\(\\alpha = \\Pr (Z \\leqslant z_{(\\alpha)} )\\) by definition. It follows that \\[\nz_{(\\alpha)} = \\frac{x_{(\\alpha)} - \\mu}{ \\sigma} ~~~~ \\mbox{and hence} ~~~~ x_{(\\alpha)} = \\sigma z_{(\\alpha)} + \\mu.\n\\]\nThus, if \\(X\\) is truly normal, a plot of the quantiles of \\(X\\) vs. the quantiles of the standard normal distribution should yield a straight line. A plot of the quantiles of \\(X\\) vs. the quantiles of \\(Z\\) is called a Q-Q plot.\nEstimating quantiles from data\nLet \\(X_{1}, \\dots, X_{n}\\) be a sequence of observations. Ideally, \\(X_{1}, \\dots, X_{n}\\) should represent i.i.d. observations but we will be happy if preliminary tests indicate that they are homoskedastic and uncorrelated (see the previous sections). We order them from the smallest to the largest and indicate this using the notation \\[\nX_{(1/n)} < X_{(2/n)} < X_{(3/n)} < \\dots < X_{\\left((n - 1)/n\\right)} < X_{(n/n)}.\n\\]\nThe above ordering assumes no ties, but ties can be quite common in data, even continuous data, because of rounding. As long as the proportion of ties is small, this method can be used.\nNote that the proportion of observations less than or equal to \\(X_{(k/n)}\\) is exactly \\(k/n\\). Hence \\(X_{(k/n)}\\), called the \\(k\\)th sample quantile, is an estimate of the population quantile \\(x_{(k/n)}\\).\nThe normal Q-Q plot is obtained by plotting the sample quantiles vs. the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. The base-R function qqnorm() produces a normal Q-Q plot of data and the function qqline() adds a line that passes through the first and third quartiles. The R package ggplot2 has analogous functions ggplot2::stat_qq() and ggplot2::stat_qq_line(). The R packages car and ggpubr also draw Q-Q plots, but also add a point-wise confidence envelope with their functions car::qqPlot() (base-R plot) and ggpubr::ggqqplot() (ggplot-type plot).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher residuals normal Q-Q plot\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5 shows the Q-Q plots of the residuals from the dishwasher example and the simulated normal data with the same mean and standard deviation.\n\nCodep1 <- ggpubr::ggqqplot(x) + \n    ggtitle(\"Random normal values\") +\n    xlab(\"Standard normal quantiles\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggpubr::ggqqplot(mod1$residuals) + \n    ggtitle(\"Model residuals\") +\n    xlab(\"Standard normal quantiles\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Normal Q-Q plots of the normally distributed simulated values \\(x_t\\) and the dishwasher residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough visually appealing, these graphical methods do not provide objective criteria to determine the normality of variables.\nShapiro–Wilk normality test\nOne of the most popular numerical methods for assessing normality is the Shapiro–Wilk (SW) test:\n\n\n\\(H_0\\): the sample data come from a normally distributed population;\n\n\\(H_1\\): the population is not normally distributed).\n\nThe SW test is the ratio of the best estimator of the variance to the usual corrected sum of squares estimator of the variance. It has been originally constructed by considering the regression of ordered sample values on corresponding expected normal order statistics. The SW statistic is given by \\[\n\\mbox{SW} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum a_{i} x_{(i)} \\right)^{2}}{\\sum \\left(x_{i} - \\bar{x} \\right)^{2}},\n\\] where \\(x_{(i)}\\) are the ordered sample values (\\(x_{(1)}\\) is the smallest) and the \\(a_{i}\\) are constants generated from the means, variances, and covariances of the order statistics of a sample of size \\(n\\) from a normal distribution. The SW statistic lies between 0 and 1. If the SW statistic is close to 1, this indicates the normality of the data. The SW statistic requires the sample size \\(n\\) to be between 7 and 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher residuals normality test\n\n\n\nBased on the \\(p\\)-values below, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of normality in both cases.\n\nshapiro.test(x)\n\n#> \n#>  Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n#> \n#> data:  x\n#> W = 0.9, p-value = 0.08\n\nshapiro.test(mod1$residuals)\n\n#> \n#>  Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n#> \n#> data:  mod1$residuals\n#> W = 1, p-value = 0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Summary of the simple linear regression residual diagnostics\n\nThe residuals do not have a constant mean.\nThe residuals seem to have a constant variance.\nThe residuals are positively correlated.\nThe residuals look normally distributed (but the SW statistic might be affected by the serial correlation of the residuals)."

    "text": "1.2 Multiple linear regression\nHere we consider a case of \\(p\\) explanatory variables \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X_{t,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p} X_{t,p} + \\epsilon_{t} \\quad (t = 1,\\dots,n).\n\\]\nThis can be expressed more compactly in a matrix notation as \\[\n\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon},\n\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{Y} = (Y_{1}, \\dots, Y_{n})^{\\top}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_{0} , \\dots, \\beta_{p})^{\\top}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = (\\epsilon_{1} , \\dots, \\epsilon_{n})^{\\top}\\); \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\) is an \\(n \\times (p + 1)\\) design matrix \\[\n\\boldsymbol{X} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n1 & X_{1,1} & \\dots & X_{1,p} \\\\\n1 & X_{2,1}& \\dots & X_{2,p} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & X_{n,1}& \\dots & X_{n,p}\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\]\nHere the historical dataset for the dependent variable consists of the observations \\(Y_{1}, \\dots, Y_{n}\\); the historical dataset for the independent variables consists of the observations in the matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\).\nMinimizing \\(SSE =(\\boldsymbol{Y} - \\boldsymbol{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})^{\\top} (\\boldsymbol{Y} - \\boldsymbol{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})\\) yields the least squares solutions \\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{Y}\n\\] for non-singular \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{X}\\).\nThe forecast of a future value \\(Y_{t}\\) is then given by \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t} = \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}_{t} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}},\n\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\) is a (column) vector at the time \\(t\\).\nUnder the OLS assumptions (recall them), we obtain \\[\n\\mathrm{var} \\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{j} \\right) = \\sigma^{2} \\left( \\boldsymbol{X }^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}_{jj},\n\\] where the \\(\\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}_{jj}\\) denotes the \\(j\\)th diagonal element of \\(\\left( \\boldsymbol{X }^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}\\).\nThis yields \\[\ns.e. \\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{j} \\right) = \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{ \\left( \\boldsymbol{X }^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}_{jj}}.\n\\]\nNote that here the degrees of freedom (d.f.) are \\(n - (p + 1) = n - p - 1\\). (The number of estimated parameters for the independent variables is \\(p\\), plus one for the intercept, i.e., \\(p + 1\\).)\nUnder the OLS assumptions, a \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\)% confidence interval for the parameter \\(\\beta_{j}\\) (\\(j = 0, 1, \\dots, p\\)) is given by \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\beta}_{j} &\\pm t_{\\alpha / 2, n - (p+1)} s.e.\\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{j} \\right) \\text{ or} \\\\\n\\hat{\\beta}_{j} &\\pm t_{\\alpha / 2, n - (p+1)} \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{\\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}_{jj}}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nTypically, \\(s.e.(\\hat{\\beta}_{j})\\) is available directly from the R output, so Equation 1.2 is calculated automatically.\nUnder the OLS assumptions, it can be shown that \\[\n\\mathrm{var} \\left( Y_{t} - \\hat{Y}_{t} \\right) = \\sigma^{2} \\left( \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}_{t} \\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{- 1} \\boldsymbol{x}_{t} + 1 \\right),\n\\] yielding a \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\)% prediction interval for \\(Y_{t}\\): \\[\n\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}_{t} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\pm t_{\\alpha / 2, n-(p+1)} \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{ \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}_{t} \\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} + 1}.\n\\]\nWe usually never perform these calculations by hand and will use the corresponding software functions, e.g., using the function predict(), see an example code below.\nWhat else can we get from the regression output?\nAs in SLR, we will look for the \\(t\\)-statistics and \\(p\\)-values to get an idea about the statistical significance of each of the predictors \\(X_{t,1}, X_{t,2}, \\dots, X_{t,p}\\). The confidence intervals constructed above correspond to individual tests of hypothesis about a parameter, i.e., \\(H_{0}\\): \\(\\beta_{j} = 0\\) vs. \\(H_{1}\\): \\(\\beta_{j} \\neq 0\\).\nWe can also make use of the \\(F\\)-test. The \\(F\\)-test considers all parameters (other than the intercept \\(\\beta_{0}\\)) simultaneously, testing \\[\n\\begin{split}\nH_{0}{:} ~ \\beta_{1} &= \\dots = \\beta_{p} = 0 ~~~ \\text{vs.} \\\\\nH_{1}{:} ~ \\beta_{j} &\\neq 0 ~~~ \\mbox{for at least one} ~~~ j \\in \\{1, \\dots, p \\}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nFormally, \\(F_{\\rm{obs}} = \\rm{MSR/MSE}\\) (the ratio of the mean square due to regression and the mean square due to stochastic errors).\nWe reject \\(H_{0}\\) when \\(F_{\\rm{obs}}\\) is too large relative to a cut-off point determined by the degrees of freedom of the \\(F\\)-distribution. The \\(p\\)-value for this \\(F\\)-test is provided in the lm() output. Rejecting \\(H_{0}\\) is equivalent to stating that the model has some explanatory value within the range of the data set, meaning that changes in at least some of the explanatory \\(X\\)-variables correlate to changes in the average value of \\(Y\\).\nRecall that \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{SST} &= \\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_t-\\overline{Y})^2= \\mathrm{SSR} + \\mathrm{SSE},\\\\\n\\mathrm{SSE} &=\\sum_{t=1}^n(Y_t-\\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 X_{t,1}-\\dots- \\hat{\\beta}_p X_{t,p})\n\\end{split}\n\\] and, hence, \\[\n\\rm{SSR}=\\rm{SST}-\\rm{SSE}.\n\\]\nTo conclude that the model has a reasonable fit, however, we would additionally like to see a high \\(R^{2}\\) value, where \\[\nR^{2} = \\rm{SSR/SST}\n\\] is the proportion of the total sum of squares explained by the regression.\nSmall \\(R^{2}\\) means that the stochastic fluctuations around the regression line (or prediction equation) are large, making the prediction task difficult, even though there may be a genuine explanatory relationship between the average value \\(\\mathrm{E}(Y)\\) and some of the \\(X\\)-variables.\nAnother criterion to judge the aptness of the obtained model is the adjusted \\(R^2\\): \\[\nR^2_{adj}=1-\\frac{n-1}{n-p}\\left( 1-R^2 \\right).\n\\]\nUnlike \\(R^2\\) itself, \\(R^2_{adj}\\) need not increase if an arbitrary (even useless) predictor is added to the model because of the correction \\((n-1)/(n-p)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe intercept \\(\\beta_{0}\\) is not included in the \\(F\\)-test because there is no explanatory variable associated with it. In other words, \\(\\beta_{0}\\) does not contribute to the regression part of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher shipments multiple linear regression\n\n\n\nLet us now extend the SLR model that we considered previously and include another potential predictor, the durable goods expenditures (billion of 1972 dollars). The goal is to build a model to predict the unit factory shipments of dishwashers (DISH) vs. private residential investment (RES) and durable goods expenditures (DUR) using a multiple linear regression model (MLR): \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X_{t,1} + \\beta_{2} X_{t,2} + \\epsilon_t,\n\\] where \\(X_{t,1}\\) is the private residential investment RES; \\(X_{t,2}\\) is the durable goods expenditures DUR.\nNow we apply the OLS method to estimate the coefficients \\(\\beta_{0}\\), \\(\\beta_{1}\\), and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) using the function lm().\n\nmod2 <- lm(DISH ~ RES + DUR, data = D)\nsummary(mod2)\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = DISH ~ RES + DUR, data = D)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n#> -643.9 -263.2  -22.1  190.2  920.0 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>             Estimate Std.

    "text": "1.3 Conclusion\nWe have recalled the standard assumptions about residuals of linear regression models. Remember that there are some other assumptions (e.g., about linear independence of predictors) that must be verified. Refer to the reading materials for a complete list.\nThe methods we have used to test the homogeneity of residuals included various residual plots. The normality of residuals can be assessed using histograms or Q-Q plots and statistical tests such as the Shapiro–Wilk normality test.\nThe use of time series in regression presents additional ways to assess patterns in the regression residuals. A plot of residuals vs. time is assessed for homogeneity and absence of trends. Less obvious patterns, such as autocorrelation, can be tested with parametric and nonparametric tests, such as the Durbin–Watson and runs tests.\nThe statistical techniques we will learn aim to model or extract as much information from time series (including the autocorrelation of regression residuals) as possible, such that the remaining series are completely random."

    "text": "2.2 Decomposition of time series\nA time series can generally be expressed as a sum or product of four distinct components: \\[\nY_t = M_t + S_t + C_t + \\epsilon_t\n\\] or \\[\nY_t = M_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot C_t \\cdot \\epsilon_t,\n\\] where\n\n\n\\(M_t\\) is the trend, representing the average change (change in the mean) in the time series over time. Examples of trends are:\\(M_t = \\beta_0\\) (constant over time, we usually refer to this case as ‘no trend’);\\(M_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1t\\) (linear increase or decrease over time);\\(M_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1t + \\beta_2t^2\\) (quadratic over time).\n\n\n\\(S_t\\) represents regular periodic fluctuations (a.k.a. seasonality) in the time series. \\(S_t\\) has the property that it is not constant but there exists an integer \\(m \\geqslant 2\\) and scaling factors \\(\\lambda_k > 0\\) such that \\(S_{t+km} = \\lambda_kS_t\\) for \\(1 \\leqslant t \\leqslant m\\) and each \\(k \\geqslant 1\\). The smallest such \\(m\\) is called the period. Periodic time series are quite common and include seasonal variability (the period is 1 year), diurnal (the period is 24 hours), and other cycles such as tides (the period is 12 hours 25 minutes). This component can be modeled using sinusoidal functions or indicator variables.\n\n\\(C_t\\) represents irregular cyclical fluctuations, i.e., sinusoidal-type movements that are of irregular length and are not as predictable as the seasonal component, e.g., El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and macroeconomic business cycles. We do not explicitly model \\(C_t\\) in this course.\n\n\\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the residual or error and represents the remaining unexplained variation in \\(Y_t\\).

    "text": "2.3 General approach to time series modeling\n\nPlot the series and examine the main features of the graph, checking whether there is\n\na trend,\na seasonal or another periodic component,\nany apparent sharp changes in behavior,\nany outlying observations.\n\n\nRemove the trend and periodic components to get stationary residuals (this step is called detrending and deseasonalizing). Broadly speaking, a time series is said to be stationary if there is\n\nno systematic change in the mean (no trend);\nno systematic change in the variance, and\nno strictly periodic variations.\n\n\nChoose a model to fit the residuals, making use of various sample statistics, including the sample autocorrelation function (ACF).\nForecast the residuals and then invert the transformations to arrive at forecasts of the original series.\n\nThere are two general classes of forecasting models.\nUnivariate time series models include different types of exponential smoothing, trend models, autoregressive models, etc. The characteristic feature of these models is that we need only one time series to start with (\\(Y_t\\)), then we can build a regression of this time series over time (\\(Y_t \\sim t\\)) for estimating the trend or, for example, an autoregressive model (‘auto’ \\(=\\) self). In the autoregressive approach, the current value \\(Y_t\\) is modeled as a function of the past values: \\[\nY_t = f(Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \\dots, Y_{t-p}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\tag{2.1}\\] while a linear autoregressive model has the form (assume that function \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is a linear parametric function, with parameters \\(\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_p\\)): \\[\nY_t = \\phi_0 + \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \\dots +\\phi_p Y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t.\n\\]\nMultivariate models involve additional covariates (a.k.a. regressors, predictors, or independent variables) \\(X_{1,t}, X_{2,t}, \\dots, X_{k,t}\\). A multivariate time series model can be as simple as the multiple regression \\[\nY_t = f(X_{1,t}, X_{2,t}, \\dots, X_{k,t}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\] or involve autoregressive components of the response (and predictors): \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_t = f(&X_{1,t}, X_{2,t}, \\dots, X_{k,t}, \\\\\n&X_{1,t-1}, X_{1,t-2}, \\dots, X_{1,t-q1}, \\\\\n&\\dots\\\\\n&X_{k,t-1}, X_{k,t-2}, \\dots, X_{k,t-qk}, \\\\\n&Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \\dots, Y_{t-p}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.2}\\] where \\(p\\), \\(q1, \\dots, qk\\) are the lags. We can start the analysis with many variables and build a forecasting model as complex as Equation 2.2, but remember that a simpler univariate model may also work well. We should create an appropriate univariate model (like in Equation 2.1) to serve as a baseline, then compare the models’ performance on some out-of-sample data, as described in Section 2.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Identify the time-series components in these plots\n\n\n\n\nCodeggplot2::autoplot(sunspots) + \n    xlab(\"\") + \n    ylab(\"Sunspot number\") + \n    theme_light()\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Monthly mean relative sunspot numbers from 1749 to 1983.

    "text": "2.4 Model comparison\nHow do we compare forecasting models to decide which one is better? We will look at various ways of choosing between models as the course progresses, but the most obvious answer is to see which one is better at predicting.\nSuppose we have used the data \\(Y_1, \\dots, Y_n\\) to build \\(M\\) forecasting models \\(\\hat{Y}^{(m)}_t\\) (\\(m = 1,\\dots,M\\)) and we now obtain future observations \\(Y_{n+1}, \\dots, Y_{n+k}\\) that were not used to fit the models (also called out-of-sample data, after-sample, or the testing set; \\(k\\) is the size of this set). The difference \\(Y_t - \\hat{Y}^{(m)}_t\\) is the forecast (or prediction) error at the time \\(t\\) for the \\(m\\)th model. For each model, compute the prediction mean square error (PMSE) \\[\nPMSE_m = k^{-1}\\sum_{t=n+1}^{n+k}\\left(Y_t - \\hat{Y}^{(m)}_t\\right)^2\n\\tag{2.3}\\] and prediction mean absolute error (PMAE) \\[\nPMAE_m = k^{-1}\\sum_{t=n+1}^{n+k}\\left|Y_t - \\hat{Y}^{(m)}_t\\right|\n\\tag{2.4}\\] and, similarly, prediction root mean square error (PRMSE; \\(PRMSE = \\sqrt{PMSE}\\)), prediction mean absolute percentage error (PMAPE, if \\(Y_t \\neq 0\\) in the testing period), etc. We choose the model with the smallest error.\nOne obvious drawback to the above method is that it requires us to wait for future observations to compare models. A way around this is to take the historical dataset \\(Y_1, \\dots, Y_n\\) and split it into a training set \\(Y_1, \\dots, Y_k\\) and a testing set \\(Y_{k+1}, \\dots, Y_n\\), where \\((n - k)\\ll k\\), i.e., most of the data goes into the training set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis scheme of splitting time series into the testing and training sets is a simple form of cross-validation. Not all forms of cross-validation apply to time series due to the usual temporal dependence in time series data. We need to select cross-validation techniques that can accommodate such dependence. Usually, it implies selecting data for validation not at random but in consecutive chunks (periods) and, ideally, with testing or validation periods being after the training period.\n\n\nForecasting models are then built using only the training set and used to ‘forecast’ values from the testing set. Sometimes it is called an out-of-sample forecast because we predict values for the times we have not used for the model specification and estimation. The testing set is used as a set of future observations to compute the PMSE. The PMSE and other errors are computed for each model over the testing set and then compared to see errors for which models are smaller.\nIf two models produce approximately the same errors, we choose the model that is simpler (involves fewer variables). This is called the law of parsimony.\nThe above error measures (PMSE, PRMSE, PMAE, etc.) compare observed and forecasted data points, hence, are measures of the accuracy of the point forecasts. Another way of comparing models could be based on the quality of their interval forecasts, i.e., by assessing how good the prediction intervals are. To assess the quality of interval forecasts, one may start by computing the empirical coverage (proportion of observations in the testing set that are within – covered by – corresponding prediction intervals for given confidence \\(C\\), e.g., 95%) and average interval width. Prediction intervals are well-calibrated if empirical coverage is close to \\(C\\) (more important) while intervals are not too wide (less important).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo select the best coverage, one can calculate the absolute differences between the nominal coverage \\(C\\) and each empirical coverage \\(\\hat{C}_m\\): \\[\n\\Delta_m = |C - \\hat{C}_m|.\n\\] Hence, we select the model with the smallest \\(\\Delta_m\\), not the largest coverage \\(C_m\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is possible to obtain different prediction intervals from the same model. For example, we can calculate prediction intervals based on normal and bootstrapped distributions. In this case, point forecasts are the same, but interval forecasts differ.\n\n\nWe may compare a great number of models using the training set, and choose the best one (with the smallest errors), however, it would be unfair to use the out-of-sample errors from the testing set for demonstrating the model performance because this part of the sample was used to select the model. Thus, it is advisable to have one more chunk of the same time series that was not used for model specification, estimation, or selection. Errors of the selected model on this validation set will be closer to the true (genuine) out-of-sample errors and can be used to improve coverage of true out-of-sample forecasts when the model is finally deployed."

Loosely speaking, a time series \\(X_t\\) (\\(t=0,\\pm 1, \\dots\\)) is stationary if it has statistical properties similar to those of the time-shifted series \\(X_{t+h}\\) for each integer \\(h\\).\nLet \\(X_t\\) be a time series with \\(\\mathrm{E}(X^2_t)<\\infty\\), then the mean function of \\(X_t\\) is \\[\n\\mu_X(t)=\\mathrm{E}(X_t).\n\\]\nThe autocovariance function of \\(X_t\\) is \\[\n\\gamma_X(r,s) = \\mathrm{cov}(X_r,X_s) = \\mathrm{E}[(X_r-\\mu_X(r))(X_s-\\mu_X(s))]\n\\tag{2.5}\\] for all integers \\(r\\) and \\(s\\).\nWeak stationarity\n\\(X_t\\) is (weakly) stationary if \\(\\mu_X(t)\\) is independent of \\(t\\), and \\(\\gamma_X(t+h,t)\\) is independent of \\(t\\) for each \\(h\\) (consider only the first two moments): \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{E}(X_t) &= \\mu, \\\\\n\\mathrm{cov}(X_t, X_{t+h}) &= \\gamma_X(h) < \\infty.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nStrong stationarity\n\\(X_t\\) is strictly stationary if (\\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\)) and (\\(X_{1+h}, \\dots, X_{n+h}\\)) have the same joint distribution (consider all moments).\nStrictly stationary \\(X_t\\) with finite variance \\(\\mathrm{E}(X_t^2) <\\infty\\) for all \\(t\\) is also weakly stationary.\nIf \\(X_t\\) is a Gaussian process, then strict and weak stationarity are equivalent (i.e., one form of stationarity implies the other).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn applications, it is usually very difficult if not impossible to verify strict stationarity. So in the vast majority of cases, we are satisfied with the weak stationarity. Moreover, we usually omit the word ‘weak’ and simply talk about stationarity (but have the weak stationary in mind).\n\n\nGiven the second condition of weak stationarity in Equation 2.6, we can write for stationary(!) time series the autocovariance function (ACVF) for the lag \\(h\\): \\[\n\\gamma_X(h)= \\gamma_X(t+h,t) = \\mathrm{cov}(X_{t+h},X_t)\n\\] and the autocorrelation function (ACF), which is the normalized autocovariance: \\[\n\\rho_X(h)=\\frac{\\gamma_X(h)}{\\gamma_X(0)}=\\mathrm{cor}(X_{t+h},X_t).\n\\]\nThe sample autocovariance function is defined as: \\[\n\\hat{\\gamma}_X(h)= n^{-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{n-k}(x_{t+h}- \\bar{x})(x_t - \\bar{x}),\n\\] with \\(\\hat{\\gamma}_X(h) = \\hat{\\gamma}_X(-h)\\) for \\(h = 0,1,\\dots, n-1\\). In R, use acf(X, type = \"covariance\").\nThe sample autocorrelation function is defined as (in R, use acf(X)): \\[\n\\hat{\\rho}_X(h)=\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_X(h)}{\\hat{\\gamma}_X(0)}.\n\\]\n\n2.6.1 Properties of autocovariance and autocorrelation functions\n\nLinearity: if \\(\\mathrm{E}(X^2) < \\infty\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}(Y^2) < \\infty\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}(Z^2) < \\infty\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are any real constants, then \\[\n\\mathrm{cov}(aX + bY + c, Z) = a\\mathrm{cov}(X,Z) + b\\mathrm{cov}(Y,Z).\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\gamma(0) \\geqslant 0\\).\n\n\\(|\\gamma(h)| \\leqslant \\gamma(0)\\) for all \\(h\\).\n\n\\(\\gamma(\\cdot)\\) is even: \\(\\gamma(h) = \\gamma(-h)\\) for all \\(h\\).\n\n\\(\\gamma(\\cdot)\\) is nonnegative definite: \\[\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^na_i \\gamma(i-j)a_j\\geqslant 0,\n\\] for all positive integers \\(n\\) and vectors \\(\\boldsymbol{a} = (a_1, \\dots, a_n)^{\\top}\\) with real-valued elements \\(a_i\\).\nThe autocorrelation function \\(\\rho(\\cdot)\\) has all the properties of autocovariance function plus \\(\\rho(0)=1\\).\nFor i.i.d. noise with finite variance, the sample autocorrelations \\(\\hat{\\rho}(h)\\), \\(h>0\\), are approximately \\(N(0,1/n)\\) for large sample size \\(n\\). Hence, approximately 95% of the sample autocorrelations should fall between the bounds \\(\\pm1.96/\\sqrt{n}\\) (1.96 is the 0.975th quantile of the standard normal distribution) – this is the bound automatically drawn by the R function acf(). Note that in R as a rule of thumb the default maximal lag is \\(10 \\log_{10}(n)\\), and the same \\(n\\) is used for the confidence bounds at all lags (however, in reality, samples of different sizes are used for each lag).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Compare ACFs of time series with and without a strong trend\n\n\n\nThe time series plot of births in Figure 2.11 shows a trend. The time series is not stationary. Thus, the calculated ACF is useless (it is calculated under the assumption of stationarity), but we notice some periodicity in the ACF – it is a sign of periodicity in the time series itself (seasonality). Need to remove the trend (and seasonality) and repeat the ACF analysis.\nCompare with the plots for accidental deaths in Figure 2.12.\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(births) + \n    xlab(\"\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of births (thousands)\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(births) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Time series plot and sample ACF of the monthly number of births in New York City, 1946–1959.\n\n\n\n\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(MASS::accdeaths) + \n    xlab(\"\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of accidental deaths\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(MASS::accdeaths) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Time series plot and sample ACF of monthly totals of accidental deaths in the USA, 1973–1978.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn base-R plots, the lags in ACF plots are measured in the number of periods. The period information (or frequency, i.e., the number of observations per period) is saved in the format ts in R:\n\nis.ts(births)\n\n#> [1] TRUE\n\nfrequency(births)\n\n#> [1] 12\n\n\nWe don’t have to convert data to this format. If we plot the ACF of just a vector without these attributes, the values are the same, just the labels on the horizontal axis are different (Figure 2.13). For monthly data, as in the example here, the frequency is 12. Hence, here the ACF at lag 0.5 (Figure 2.13 A) means autocorrelation with the lag \\(h=6\\) months (Figure 2.13 B); lag 1 (Figure 2.13 A) corresponds to one whole period of \\(h=12\\) months (Figure 2.13 B), and so on.\n\nCodepar(mar = c(4, 4, 3, 1) + 0.1, mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\nacf(births, lag.max = 37, las = 1, main = \"A) Input is a ts object\")\nacf(as.numeric(births), lag.max = 37, las = 1, main = \"B) Input is a numeric vector\")\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: In base-R graphics, the x-axis labels in ACF plots differ depending on the input format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ts objects in R cannot incorporate varying periods (e.g., different numbers of days or weeks because of leap years), therefore, we recommend using this format only for monthly or annual data. Setting frequency = 365.25 for daily data could be an option (although not very accurate) to accommodate leap years.\nConverting to the ts format usually is not required for analysis. Most of the time we use plain numeric vectors and data frames in R.\nContributed R packages offer additional formats for time series, e.g., see the packages xts and zoo.\n\n\nACF measures the correlation between \\(X_t\\) and \\(X_{t+h}\\). The correlation can be due to a direct connection or through the intermediate steps \\(X_{t+1}, X_{t+2}, \\dots, X_{t+h-1}\\). Partial ACF looks at the correlation between \\(X_t\\) and \\(X_{t+h}\\) once the effect of intermediate steps is removed."

If the variables are multivariate normal, then this definition coincides with \\(\\rho_{XY|Z} = \\mathrm{cor}(X,Y | Z)\\).\nThe partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of a stationary process, \\(X_t\\), denoted \\(\\rho_{hh}\\), for \\(h = 1,2,\\dots\\), is \\[\n\\rho_{11} = \\mathrm{cor}(X_t, X_{t+1}) = \\rho(1)\n\\] and \\[\n\\rho_{hh} = \\mathrm{cor}(X_t - \\hat{X}_t, X_{t+h} - \\hat{X}_{t+h}), \\; h\\geqslant 2.\n\\]\nBoth \\((X_t - \\hat{X}_t)\\) and \\((X_{t+h} - \\hat{X}_{t+h})\\) are uncorrelated with \\(\\{ X_{t+1}, \\dots, X_{t+h-1}\\}\\). The PACF, \\(\\rho_{hh}\\), is the correlation between \\(X_{t+h}\\) and \\(X_t\\) with the linear dependence of everything between them (intermediate lags), namely \\(\\{ X_{t+1}, \\dots, X_{t+h-1}\\}\\), on each, removed.\nIn other notations, the PACF for the lag \\(h\\) and predictions \\(P\\) is \\[\n\\rho_{hh} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } h = 0 \\\\\n\\mathrm{cor}(X_t, X_{t+1}) = \\rho(1) & \\text{if } h = 1 \\\\\n\\mathrm{cor}(X_t - P(X_t | X_{t+1}, \\dots, X_{t+h-1}), \\\\\n\\quad\\;\\; X_{t+1} - P(X_{t+h} | X_{t+1}, \\dots, X_{t+h-1})) & \\text{if } h > 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nTo obtain sample estimates of PACF in R, use pacf(X) or acf(X, type = \"partial\").\nCorrelation and partial correlation coefficients measure the strength and direction of the relationship, changing within \\([-1, 1]\\). The percent of explained variance for the case of two variables is measured by squared correlation (r-squared; \\(R^2\\); coefficient of determination) changing within \\([0, 1]\\), so a correlation of 0.2 means only 4% of variance explained by the simple linear relationship (regression). To report a partial correlation, for example, of 0.2 at lag 3, one could say something like ‘The partial autocorrelation at lag 3 (after removing the influence of the intermediate lags 1 and 2) is 0.2’ (depending on the application, the correlation of 0.2 can be considered weak or moderate strength) or ‘After accounting for autocorrelation at intermediate lags 1 and 2, the linear relationship at lag 3 can explain 4% of the remaining variability.’\nThe partial autocorrelation coefficients of i.i.d. time series are asymptotically distributed as \\(N(0,1/n)\\). Hence, for lags \\(h > p\\), where \\(p\\) is the optimal or true order of the partial autocorrelation, \\(\\rho_{hh} < 1.96/\\sqrt{n}\\) (assuming the confidence level 95%). This suggests using as a preliminary estimator of the order \\(p\\) the smallest value \\(m\\) such that \\(\\rho_{hh} < 1.96/\\sqrt{n}\\) for \\(h > m\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: ACF and PACF of accdeaths\n\n\n\nBy plotting ACF and PACF (Figure 2.14), we observe that most of the temporal dependence (autocorrelation) in this time series is due to correlation with the immediately preceding values (see PACF at lag 1).\n\nCodep1 <- forecast::ggAcf(MASS::accdeaths) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(MASS::accdeaths, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: ACF and PACF plots of the monthly accidental deaths."

For identification, we need \\(\\sum_{t=1}^m S_t = 0\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}(\\epsilon_t)=0\\).\nOur goal is to estimate and extract \\(M_t\\) and \\(S_t\\) with the hope that the residual or noise component \\(\\epsilon_t\\) will turn out to be a stationary time series (Section 3.2–Section 3.5). Alternatively, Box–Jenkins models use difference operators repeatedly to the series \\(Y_t\\) until a stationary time series is obtained (see Section 3.6 on differencing).\nThe seasonal component is said to have constant seasonal variation if the scaling factors satisfy \\(\\lambda_{k} = 1\\) for all \\(k\\). In other words, \\(S_{t+m} = S_{t}\\) for all \\(t\\). The constant variation is an assumption of most modeling techniques we will be using in this course. Unfortunately, many real seasonal time series do not have this constancy property and it is necessary to first perform a variance-stabilizing transformation to modify the original time series into one with constant variation. To some extent, this is a matter of trial and error, where we work from ‘weaker’ transformations to ‘stronger’ transformations as needed. Typically, power transformations are used \\(Y_{t} \\rightarrow Y^{\\lambda}_{t}\\), where \\(0 < \\lambda < 1\\) or, log or even log log transformations, e.g., \\(Y_{t} \\rightarrow \\log Y_{t}\\).\nThe log transformation of \\(Y_t\\) is convenient when we assume not an additive model as Equation 3.1 is, but a multiplicative model as \\[\nY_t = M_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot \\epsilon_t.\n\\tag{3.2}\\] When applying variance-stabilizing log transformation to Equation 3.2, we get an additive result: \\[\n\\log Y_t = \\log M_t + \\log S_t + \\log \\epsilon_t,\n\\tag{3.3}\\] which is now similar to Equation 3.1. We will refer to Equation 3.1 as additive seasonality, and to Equation 3.2 as multiplicative seasonality. Only a few methods can deal with the multiplicative case Equation 3.2 directly; most methods we consider in this course will require us to apply a transformation as in Equation 3.3.\nIn the following sections, we consider methods for the estimation and elimination of \\(M_t\\) (for non-seasonal data, when \\(S_t = 0\\) in the additive case Equation 3.1 or \\(S_t = 1\\) in the multiplicative case Equation 3.2) and of both \\(M_t\\) and \\(S_t\\) (for seasonal data)."

Remember that the sum of \\(S_t\\) within each period is 0. Hence, to smooth out the seasonal component (and noise) and get an estimate of just \\(M_t\\), we will use a moving window \\(w\\) sized as the seasonal period \\(m\\) (more generally, \\(w = km\\), where \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}^{+}\\), if a greater smoothness is desired). It will often lead to the even window size \\(w\\). For even \\(w\\), Equation 3.4 is modified as follows (we now use \\(km + 1\\) elements so the window is still centered, but the elements on the ends receive half the weight): \\[\n\\hat{M}_t = \\frac{0.5Y_{t-km/2} + Y_{t-km/2 + 1} +\\dots+Y_{t+km/2-1} + 0.5Y_{t+km/2}}{km}.\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\n\nUse \\(Y_t - \\hat{M}_t\\) to estimate the seasonal component – get \\(\\hat{S}_t\\). If needed, correct the estimates, to sum up to 0 in each period. Let \\(\\hat{S}^*_t\\) be the corrected values.\nUse deseasonalized data \\(Y_t - \\hat{S}^*_t\\) to re-estimate the trend. Let \\(\\hat{M}^*_t\\) be the corrected trend estimate.\nThe estimated random noise is then: \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_t = Y_t - \\hat{M}^*_t - \\hat{S}^*_t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the multiplicative case, replace subtractions with divisions and let the product of \\(\\hat{S}^*_t\\) be 1 within each seasonal period.\n\n\nThe above algorithm is implemented in stats::decompose(), but its main disadvantage is in the centered moving average filter used to estimate \\(M_t\\) that does not produce smoothed values for the most recent observations. We can elaborate this algorithm, first, by using different estimators for \\(M_t\\); second, by also replacing estimators for \\(S_t\\) (e.g., see the next section).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Secchi depth automatic (simple moving average-based) decomposition\n\n\n\nConsider monthly data of Secchi disk depth measured at station CB1.1 in Chesapeake Bay (Figure 3.4), with the decomposition in Figure 3.5.\n\nCodeload(\"./data/Secchi_CB1.1.RData\")\npSecchi <- ggplot2::autoplot(Secchi, col = \"grey50\") + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"Secchi depth (m)\") + \n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(Secchi) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\npSecchi + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Monthly average Secchi disk depth at station CB1.1 and its ACF.\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeggplot2::autoplot(stats::decompose(Secchi))  + \n    theme_light()\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Trend-seasonal decomposition of monthly average Secchi disk depth at station CB1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Secchi depth manual simple moving average smoothing\n\n\n\nTo replicate the behavior of the function stats::decompose() or tune the outputs, use the following code.

    "text": "3.3 Lowess smoothing\nOne of the alternatives for estimating trends \\(M_t\\) is locally weighted regression (shortened as ‘lowess’ or ‘loess’) (Cleveland 1979). We can apply lowess as a regression of \\(Y_t\\) on time, for example, using the algorithm outlined by Berk (2016):\n\nChoose the smoothing parameter such as bandwidth, \\(f\\), which is a proportion between 0 and 1.\nChoose a point \\(t_0\\) and its \\(w = f n\\) nearest points on the time axis.\nFor these \\(w\\) nearest neighbor points, compute a weighted least squares regression line for \\(Y_t\\) on \\(t\\). The coefficients \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) of such regression are estimated by minimizing the residual sum of squares \\[\n\\text{RSS}^*(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = (\\boldsymbol{Y}^* - \\boldsymbol{X}^* \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{W}^* (\\boldsymbol{Y}^* - \\boldsymbol{X}^* \\boldsymbol{\\beta}),\n\\] where the asterisk indicates that only the observations in the window are included. The regressor matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^*\\) can contain polynomial terms of time, \\(t\\). The \\(\\boldsymbol{W}^*\\) is a diagonal matrix conforming to \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^*\\), with diagonal elements being a function of distance from \\(t_0\\) (observations closer to \\(t_0\\) receive higher weights).\nCalculate the fitted value \\(\\tilde{Y}_t\\) for that single \\(t_0\\).\nRepeat Steps 2–4 for each \\(t_0 = 1,\\dots,n\\).\n\nBy selecting large bandwidth \\(f\\) in the lowess algorithm, we can obtain greater smoothing (see Figure 3.7).\n\nCodedata(WWWusage)\nps <- lapply(c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75), function(w){\n    ggplot2::autoplot(WWWusage, colour = \"grey50\")  + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"span = \", w)) +\n        theme_light() + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", span = w, se = FALSE)\n})\nwrap_plots(ps, ncol = 2) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: A lowess illustration, adapted from Berk (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe function ggplot2::geom_smooth() has the default setting se = TRUE that produces a confidence interval around the smooth. In time series applications, autocorrelated residuals may lead to underestimated standard errors and incorrect (typically, too narrow) confidence intervals. Hence, we set se = FALSE. For testing the significance of the identified trends, see lectures on trend testing (detection).\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Lowess smoothing for seasonal data\nNow use the Secchi time series (Figure 3.4) and implement the procedure of detrending and deseasonalizing from Section 3.2.1, but replace the simple moving average estimates of \\(M_t\\) with lowess estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Secchi depth lowess-based decomposition\n\n\n\n\nYt <- Secchi\nt <- as.vector(time(Yt))\nmonth <- as.factor(cycle(Yt))\n\n# 1.

    "text": "3.4 Exponential smoothing\nExponential smoothing (ES) is a successful forecasting technique. It turns out that ES can be modified to be used effectively for time series with\n\nslowly drifting trend (double exponential smoothing);\ntrends (Holt’s method);\nseasonal patterns;\ncombination of trend and seasonality (Holt–Winters method).\n\nES is easy to adjust for past errors and easy to prepare follow-on forecasts. ES is ideal for situations where many forecasts must be prepared. Several different functional forms of ES are used depending on the presence of trend or cyclical variations.\nIn short, an ES is an averaging technique that uses unequal weights while the weights applied to past observations decline in an exponential manner.\nSingle exponential smoothing calculates the smoothed series as a damping coefficient \\(\\alpha\\) (\\(\\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\)) times the actual series plus \\(1 - \\alpha\\) times the lagged value of the smoothed series. For the model \\[\nY_{t} = M_t + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\] the updating equation is \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{M}_1 &= Y_1\\\\\n\\hat{M}_t &= \\alpha Y_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\hat{M}_{t - 1}\n\\end{split}\n\\] and the forecast is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+1} = \\hat{M}_t.\n\\]\nAn exponential smoothing over an already smoothed time series is called double exponential smoothing. In some cases, it might be necessary to extend it even to a triple exponential smoothing.\nHolt’s linear exponential smoothing Suppose that the series \\(Y_t\\) is non-seasonal but displays a trend. Now we need to estimate both the current mean (or level in some professional jargon) and the current trend.\nThe updating equations express ideas similar to those for exponential smoothing. However, now we have two smoothing parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (\\(\\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\); \\(\\beta \\in [0, 1]\\)).\nThe updating equations are \\[\na_{t} = \\alpha Y_{t} + \\left( 1- \\alpha \\right) \\left( a_{t - 1} + b_{t - 1} \\right)\n\\] for the mean and \\[\nb_{t} = \\beta \\left( a_{t} - a_{t-1} \\right) + \\left( 1 - \\beta \\right) b_{t-1}\n\\] for the trend.\nThen the forecasting for \\(k\\) steps into the future is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+k} = a_{t} + kb_{t}.\n\\]\nUsually, the initial (starting) values are \\[\n\\begin{split}\na_{1} & = Y_{2}, \\\\\nb_{1} & = Y_{2} - Y_{1}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Shampoo exponential smoothing\n\n\n\nSee an example in Figure 3.11.\n\nCodeclrs <- c(\"0.3\" = 4, \"0.7\" = 2)\nm1 <- HoltWinters(shampoo, alpha = 0.3, beta = FALSE, gamma = FALSE)\nm2 <- HoltWinters(shampoo, alpha = 0.7, beta = FALSE, gamma = FALSE)\np1 <- pshampoo + \n    geom_line(data = fitted(m1)[,1], aes(col = \"0.3\"), lwd = 1.5) + \n    geom_line(data = fitted(m2)[,1], aes(col = \"0.7\"), lwd = 1.5) +\n    ggtitle(\"Simple exponential smoothing\") +\n    labs(color = \"\\u03b1\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = clrs)\nclrs <- c(\"(0.3, 0.3)\" = 4, \"(0.7, 0.7)\" = 2)\nm1 <- HoltWinters(shampoo, alpha = 0.3, beta = 0.3, gamma = FALSE)\nm2 <- HoltWinters(shampoo, alpha = 0.7, beta = 0.7, gamma = FALSE)\np2 <- pshampoo + \n    geom_line(data = fitted(m1)[,1], aes(col = \"(0.3, 0.3)\"), lwd = 1.5) + \n    geom_line(data = fitted(m2)[,1], aes(col = \"(0.7, 0.7)\"), lwd = 1.5) +\n    ggtitle(\"Holt's method\") +\n    labs(color = \"(\\u03b1, \\u03b2)\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = clrs)\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Shampoo sales over three years smoothed with different exponential smoothing filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Exponential smoothing for seasonal data\nMultiplicative Holt–Winters procedure\nNow in addition to the Holt parameters, suppose that the series exhibits multiplicative seasonality and let \\(S_{t}\\) be the multiplicative seasonal factor at the time \\(t\\).\nSuppose also that there are \\(m\\) observations in one period (in a year). For example, \\(m = 4\\) for quarterly data, and \\(m = 12\\) for monthly data.\nIn some time series, seasonal variation is so strong it obscures any trends or other cycles, which are important for our understanding of the observed process. Holt–Winters smoothing method can remove seasonality and makes long-term fluctuations in the series stand out more clearly.\nA simple way of detecting a trend in seasonal data is to take averages over a certain period. If these averages change with time we can say that there is evidence of a trend in the series.\nWe now use three smoothing parameters: \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) (\\(\\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\); \\(\\beta \\in [0, 1]\\); \\(\\gamma \\in [0, 1]\\)).\nThe updating equations for the level (\\(a_t\\)), local trend (\\(b_t\\)), and seasonal factor (\\(S_t\\)) are: \\[\n\\begin{split}\na_{t} & = \\alpha Y_{t} / S_{t - m} + (1 - \\alpha) ( a_{t - 1} + b_{t - 1}), \\\\\nb_{t} & = \\beta (a_{t} - a_{t - 1}) + (1 - \\beta) b_{t - 1}, \\\\\nS_{t} & = \\gamma Y_{t} / a_{t} + (1 - \\gamma) S_{t - m}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThen the forecasting for \\(k\\) steps into the future is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+k} = (a_{t} + kb_{t}) S_{t+k-m},\n\\] where \\(k = 1, 2, \\dots, m\\).\nTo obtain starting values, one may use an average over the first few periods (years) of the data.\nThe smoothing parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared one-step prediction errors.\nAdditive Holt–Winters procedure\nThe updating equations are \\[\n\\begin{split}\na_{t} & = \\alpha (Y_{t} - S_{t - m}) + (1 - \\alpha) (a_{t - 1} + b_{t - 1}), \\\\\nb_{t} & = \\beta (a_{t} - a_{t - 1}) + (1 - \\beta) b_{t - 1} \\\\\nS_{t} & = \\gamma (Y_{t} - a_{t}) + (1 - \\gamma) S_{t - m}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThen the forecasting for \\(k\\) steps into the future is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+k} = a_{t} + kb_{t} + S_{t + k - m},\n\\] where \\(k = 1, 2, \\dots, m\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers non-seasonal and seasonal exponential smoothing\n\n\n\nMonthly totals of international airline passengers, 1949–1960 (see Figure 3.12).

    "text": "3.5 Polynomial regression on time\nThis is a very intuitive procedure for fitting parametric trend functions to time series:\n\nMake a parametric model assumption about \\(M_t\\) as a function of time \\(t\\), for example, quadratic trend: \\[\nM_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 t + \\beta_2 t^2\n\\]\n\nFit the model using the usual regression estimators (least squares or maximum likelihood)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA nonstationary time series with a trend represented by a parametric function is a typical example of a trend-stationary time series or a time series with a deterministic trend. It is easy to make such a time series stationary by modeling and extracting the trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers non-seasonal polynomial smoothing\n\n\n\nContinue using the AirPassengers data and fit linear and quadratic trends.\n\nt <- as.vector(time(AirPassengers))\nt2 <- t^2\ntm1 <- lm(AirPassengers ~ t)\ntm2.1 <- lm(AirPassengers ~ t + t2)\ntm2.2 <- lm(AirPassengers ~ t + I(t^2))\ntm2.3 <- lm(AirPassengers ~ poly(t, degree = 2))\n\nAfter estimating the trend coefficients with OLS, visualize the results (Figure 3.14).\n\nCodep1 <- pAirPassengers + \n    geom_line(aes(y = tm1$fitted.values), col = 4, lwd = 1.5) + \n    ggtitle(\"Linear trend\")\np2 <- pAirPassengers + \n    geom_line(aes(y = tm2.3$fitted.values), col = 4, lwd = 1.5) + \n    ggtitle(\"Quadratic trend\")\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14: The plots of the AirPassengers data with estimated parametric linear and quadratic trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe models tm2.1 and tm2.2 are equivalent. Model tm2.1 uses a pre-calculated quadratic transformation, while model tm2.2 applies the transformation on the fly within the R formula call, using the I() syntax (without the I() wrapper, the output of tm2.2 would be the same as of tm1, not tm2.1). However, both models tm2.1 and tm2.2 can easily violate the assumption of independence of predictors in linear regression, especially when values of the time index \\(t\\) are large. That is the case for us because the sequence \\(t\\) represents decimal years, from 1949 to 1960.917, and \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{cor}}(t, t^2) =\\) 1. Therefore, model tm2.3 is preferred, because it is evaluated on orthogonal polynomials (basically, centering and normalization are applied to \\(t\\) and \\(t^2\\)).\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Seasonal regression with dummy variables\nTo each time \\(t\\) and each season \\(k\\) we will assign an indicator that ‘turns on’ if and only if \\(t\\) falls into that season. In principle, a seasonal period of any positive integer length \\(m \\geqslant 2\\) is possible, however, in most cases, the length of the seasonal cycle is one year and so the seasonal period of the time series depends on the number of observations per year. The most common periods are \\(m = 12\\) (monthly data) and \\(m = 4\\) (quarterly data). For each \\(k = 1, \\dots, m\\), we define the indicator \\[\nX_{k,t} = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n1, & \\mbox{if} ~ t ~ \\text{corresponds to season} ~ k, \\\\\n0, & \\mbox{if} ~ t ~ \\text{does not correspond to season} ~ k. \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nNote that for each \\(t\\) we have \\(X_{1,t} + X_{2,t} + \\dots + X_{m,t} = 1\\) since each \\(t\\) corresponds to exactly one season. Thus, given any \\(m - 1\\) of the variables, the remaining variable is known and thus redundant. Because of this linear dependence, we must drop one of the indicator variables (seasons) from the model. It does not matter which season is dropped although sometimes there are choices that are simpler from the point of view of constructing or labeling the design matrix. Thus the general form of a seasonal model looks like \\[\n\\begin{split}\nf (Y_{t}) &= M_{t} + \\beta_{2} X_{2,t} + \\beta_{3} X_{3,t} + \\dots + \\beta_{m} X_{m,t} + \\epsilon_{t} \\\\\n&= M_{t} + \\sum_{i=2}^{m}\\beta_{i} X_{i,t} + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\end{split}\n\\] where \\(M_{t}\\) is a trend term which may also include some \\(\\beta\\) parameters and explanatory variables. The function \\(f\\) represents the appropriate variance-stabilizing transformations as needed. (Here the 1st season has been dropped from the model.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers polynomial smoothing with dummy variables for the seasons\n\n\n\nConsider adding the dummy variables to model seasonality together with the quadratic trend in the AirPassengers time series. We noticed multiplicative seasonality in this time series before, therefore we apply a logarithmic transformation to the original data to transform the multiplicative seasonality into additive. That is, we need to estimate the model \\[\n\\ln(Y_{t}) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t + \\alpha_2 t^2 + \\sum_{i=2}^{12}\\beta_{i} X_{i,t} + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\] where \\(X_{i,t}\\) are the dummy variables for the months. (Here the first month has been dropped from the model, the same as in R the first factor level is dropped.)\nIf we were doing the regression analysis by hand, we would create a design matrix with a few top rows looking like this:\n\n\n#>          t      t2 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7 X8 X9 X10 X11 X12\n#>  [1,] 1949 3798601  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [2,] 1949 3798926  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [3,] 1949 3799251  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [4,] 1949 3799576  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [5,] 1949 3799900  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [6,] 1949 3800225  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [7,] 1950 3800550  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [8,] 1950 3800875  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0   0   0   0\n#>  [9,] 1950 3801200  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1   0   0   0\n#> [10,] 1950 3801525  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   1   0   0\n#> [11,] 1950 3801850  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   1   0\n#> [12,] 1950 3802175  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   1\n#> [13,] 1950 3802500  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe way the months are represented above as separate columns of 0s and 1s is called one-hot encoding in the field of machine learning.\n\n\nIn R, it is enough to have one variable representing the seasons. This categorical variable should be saved as a factor. Then we apply the OLS method to find the model coefficients (see results in Figure 3.15):\n\nMonth <- as.factor(cycle(AirPassengers))\nm <- lm(log(AirPassengers) ~ poly(t, degree = 2) + Month)\nsummary(m)\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = log(AirPassengers) ~ poly(t, degree = 2) + Month)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n#> -0.12748 -0.03709  0.00418  0.03197  0.11529 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>                      Estimate Std.

For example, for monthly observations \\[\n\\begin{split}\ncos_{k} (i) &= \\cos (2 \\pi ki / 12), \\\\\nsin_{k} (i) &= \\sin (2 \\pi ki / 12),\n\\end{split}\n\\] where \\(i\\) is the month within the year, and the trigonometric function has \\(k\\) cycles per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers polynomial smoothing with Fourier series for the seasons\n\n\n\nNow let us apply the method of sinusoids to the AirPassengers time series. We have one prominent and, possibly, one less prominent peak per year. Hence, we can test the model with \\(k = 1\\) and \\(k = 2\\). We will construct the following trigonometric predictors: \\[\n\\begin{split}\ncos_{1,t} &= \\cos(2 \\pi \\text{month}_t/12),\\\\\nsin_{1,t} &= \\sin(2 \\pi \\text{month}_t/12),\\\\\ncos_{2,t} &= \\cos(4 \\pi \\text{month}_t/12),\\\\\nsin_{2,t} &= \\sin(4 \\pi \\text{month}_t/12)\n\\end{split}\n\\] to use in the model \\[\n\\ln(Y_{t}) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t + \\alpha_2 t^2 + \\beta_{1}cos_{1,t} + \\beta_{2}sin_{1,t} + \\beta_{3}cos_{2,t} + \\beta_{4}sin_{2,t} + \\epsilon_{t}.\n\\]\nCalculate the predictors and estimate the model in R (see results in Figure 3.16):\n\nmonth <- as.numeric(cycle(AirPassengers))\ncos1 <- cos(2 * pi * month / 12)\nsin1 <- sin(2 * pi * month / 12)\ncos2 <- cos(4 * pi * month / 12)\nsin2 <- sin(4 * pi * month / 12)\nm <- lm(log(AirPassengers) ~ poly(t, degree = 2) + cos1 + sin1 + cos2 + sin2)\nsummary(m)\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = log(AirPassengers) ~ poly(t, degree = 2) + cos1 + \n#>     sin1 + cos2 + sin2)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n#> -0.20078 -0.03539 -0.00056  0.04065  0.13771 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>                      Estimate Std.

    "text": "3.6 Differencing\nA big subset of time series models (particularly, models dealing with random walk series) applies the differencing to eliminate trends.\nLet \\(\\Delta\\) be the difference operator (\\(\\nabla\\) notation is also used sometimes), then the simple first-order differences are: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\Delta Y_t &= Y_t - Y_{t-1} \\\\\n&=(1-B)Y_t,\n\\end{split}\n\\] where \\(B\\) is a backshift operator.\nThe backshift operator and difference operator are useful for a convenient representation of higher-order differences. We will often use backshift operators in future lectures: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nB^0Y_{t} &= Y_{t} \\\\\nBY_{t} &= Y_{t-1} \\\\\nB^{2}Y_{t} &= Y_{t-2} \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\nB^{k}Y_{t} &= Y_{t-k}.\n\\end{split}\n\\] The convenience is because the powers of the operators can be treated as powers of elements of usual polynomials, so we can make different operations for more complex cases.\nFor example, if we took second-order differences, \\(\\Delta^2Y_t = (1-B)^2Y_t\\), to remove a trend and then used differences with the seasonal lag of 12 months to remove a strong seasonal component, what would be the final form of the transformed series? The transformed series, \\(Y^*_t\\), will be: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY^*_t & = (1-B)^2 (1 - B^{12})Y_t \\\\\n& = (1 - 2B + B^2) (1 - B^{12})Y_t \\\\\n& = (1 - 2B + B^2 - B^{12} + 2B^{13} - B^{14})Y_t \\\\\n& = Y_t - 2Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-2} - Y_{t-12} + 2Y_{t-13}-Y_{t-14},\n\\end{split}\n\\] but we will often use just the top-row notations.\nWe will discuss formal tests to identify an appropriate order of differences in future lectures (unit-root tests), but for now use the rule of thumb: for time trends looking linear use 1st order differences (\\(\\Delta Y_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}\\)), for parabolic shapes use differences of the 2nd order, etc. Apply the differencing of higher orders until the time series looks stationary (plot the transformed series and its ACF at each step). In practice, differences of order 3 or higher are rarely needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA nonstationary time series that can be converted to stationary by taking differences is also sometimes called a difference-stationary time series or a time series with a stochastic trend. Very rarely, a time series may contain both deterministic and stochastic trends that need to be modeled or removed for further analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Shampoo detrending by differencing\n\n\n\nRemove the trend from the shampoo series by applying the differences.\nBased on Figure 3.17, differencing once is enough to remove the trend. The resulting detrended series is \\[\nY^*_t = \\Delta Y_t = (1 - B)Y_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}.\n\\]\n\nCodep1 <- pshampoo +\n    ggtitle(\"Yt\")\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(shampoo) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np3 <- ggplot2::autoplot(diff(shampoo)) + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"Sales\") + \n    ggtitle(\"D1\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(diff(shampoo)) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np5 <- ggplot2::autoplot(diff(shampoo, differences = 2)) + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"Sales\") +\n    ggtitle(\"D2\") +\n    theme_light()\np6 <- forecast::ggAcf(diff(shampoo, differences = 2)) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\n(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4) / (p5 + p6) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 3.17: Time series plot of shampoo sales with an estimated ACF and the differenced series with their ACFs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA deterministic linear trend can be also eliminated by differencing. For example, consider a time series \\(X-t\\) with a deterministic linear trend: \\[\nX_t = a + b t + Z_t,\n\\] where \\(Z_t \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0,\\sigma^2)\\). The first-order differences of \\(X_t\\) remove the linear trend: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n(1 - B)X_t &= X_t - X_{t-1} \\\\\n&= a + b t + Z_t - (a + b (t - 1) + Z_{t-1}) \\\\\n&= a + b t + Z_t - a - b t + b - Z_{t-1} \\\\\n&= b + Z_t + Z_{t-1}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers detrending and deseasonalizing by differencing\n\n\n\nRemove trend and seasonality from the log-transformed AirPassengers series by applying the differences.\nBased on Figure 3.18, differencing once with the non-seasonal and the seasonal lags is enough to remove the trend and strong seasonality. The final series (denoted as D1D12) is \\[\n\\begin{split}\nD1D12_t & = (1 - B)(1 - B^{12})\\lg Y_t = (1 - B - B^{12} + B^{13})\\lg Y_t\\\\\n& = \\lg Y_t - \\lg Y_{t-1} - \\lg Y_{t-12} + \\lg Y_{t-13}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nCodeYt <- log10(AirPassengers)\n\n# Apply first-order (non-seasonal) differences\nD1 <- diff(Yt)\n\n# Additionally, apply first-order seasonal differences\nD1D12 <- diff(D1, lag = 12)\n\np1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(Yt) + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"log10(Air passangers)\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Yt\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(Yt) + \n    ggtitle(\"Yt\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np3 <- ggplot2::autoplot(D1) + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"log10(Air passangers)\") + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)Yt\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(D1) + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)Yt\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np5 <- ggplot2::autoplot(D1D12) + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"log10(Air passangers)\") + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)(1-B12)Yt\") +\n    theme_light()\np6 <- forecast::ggAcf(D1D12) + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)(1-B12)Yt\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\n(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4) / (p5 + p6) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 3.18: Time series plot of the airline passenger series with an estimated ACF and the detrended (differenced) series with their ACFs."

    "text": "3.7 Conclusion\nWe have implemented various methods for trend visualization, modeling, and trend removal. In each case, the method could be extended to additionally remove from a time series a strong seasonal signal. The choice of a method depends on many things, such as:\n\nThe methods require different skill levels (and time commitment) for their implementation and can be categorized as automatic and non-automatic.\nSome methods are very flexible when dealing with seasonality (e.g., Holt–Winters), while others are not.\nThe goal of smoothing and desired degree of smoothness in the output.\nSome of the methods have a convenient way of getting forecasts (e.g., exponential smoothing and polynomial regression), while other methods are more suitable for interpolation (polynomial regression) and simple visualization (simple moving average), or just trend elimination (all of the considered methods are capable of eliminating trends, but differencing is the method that does nothing else but the elimination).\n\nRemember that forecasted values (point forecasts) are not valuable if their uncertainty is not quantified. To quantify the uncertainty, we provide prediction intervals that are based on the past behavior of residuals and careful residual diagnostics (such as described in the previous lectures).\nThe evaluation of the methods may involve splitting the time series into training and testing periods. Overall, this lecture focused on presenting the methods themselves, while residual diagnostics and evaluation on a testing set were omitted due to time constraints.\nWhile the considered methods are among the most common, there are many more smoothing methods that can be applied to time series: splines (such as used in generalized additive models, GAMs), kernels, machine learning techniques, etc."

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nAfter removing or modeling a trend and strong seasonality in a time series, we need to take care of the stationary remainder, which may be autocorrelated or conditionally heteroskedastic. Here we introduce a broad class of ARMA models that deal with autocorrelation in time series.\nRecall that a time series is (weakly) stationary if its mean and autocovariance do not depend on time, \\(t\\); autocovariance depends only on the lag \\(h\\). We will use these two conditions to show that the time series processes that we will model as AR, MA, or ARMA are stationary. Remember that the presence of autocorrelation does not mean that there is a trend.\nWe start by checking the two conditions for other typical univariate processes: white noise and random walk.\n\nCode# Set seed for reproducible random number generation\nset.seed(123) \nT <- 300L\nLag <- 0:15\n\n\nMost of the examples in this lecture are simulated to show how sample autocorrelations may differ from theoretical ones, even if the simulated time series are sampled from a process of a certain type. All simulated series are of length 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Check the stationarity of white noise\n\n\n\nLet \\(X_t\\) be a white noise series, \\(X_t \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0, \\sigma^2)\\). Show that \\(X_t\\) is weakly stationary.\n\\(\\mathrm{E}(X_t) = 0\\) for all \\(t\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\mathrm{E}(X_t)\\) is independent of \\(t\\).\nNow check the autocovariance \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{cov}(X_t, X_{t+h}) &=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{cov}(X_t, X_t) & \\text{if } h = 0\\\\\n0                      & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n& =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{var}(X_t) & \\text{if } h = 0\\\\\n0                 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n& =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\sigma^2 & \\text{if } h = 0\\\\\n0        & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\mathrm{cov}(X_t, X_{t+h})\\) does not depend on \\(t\\), depends only on \\(h\\).\nBoth conditions of weak stationarity are satisfied, \\(X_t\\) is weakly stationary.\n\n\nSee Figure 4.1 with plots for \\(X_t \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0, \\sigma^2)\\), where \\(\\sigma = 2\\).

Also, notice that \\(S_t = S_{t-1} + X_t\\), that is, \\(S_t\\) is a nonstationary AR(1) process with \\(\\phi_1 = 1\\).\n\n\nRandom walk patterns are widely found in nature, for example, in the phenomenon of Brownian motion. Notice the slow linear decay in the ACF of nonstationary time series (Figure 4.2) \\[\nS_t = \\sum_{i = 1}^t X_i,\n\\tag{4.2}\\] where \\(X_t \\sim \\mathrm{i.i.d.}(0, \\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\sigma = 2\\).\n\nCode# Sample data\nRW0 <- ts(cumsum(X))\n\n# Plots\np3 <- forecast::autoplot(RW0) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample time series\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(RW0) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np5 <- forecast::ggAcf(RW0, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 + p4 + p5 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Zero-mean random walk as specified in Equation 4.2.\n\n\n\n\nRandom walk may look very different if the i.i.d. process has a non-zero mean. Here is a random walk with drift (Figure 4.3): \\[\nS_t = \\sum_{i = 1}^t X_i,\n\\tag{4.3}\\] where \\(X_t \\sim \\mathrm{i.i.d.}(a, \\sigma^2)\\), \\(a = 0.2\\), and \\(\\sigma = 2\\).\n\nCode# Sample data\nRW2 <- ts(cumsum(X + 0.2))\n\n# Plots\np3 <- forecast::autoplot(RW2) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample time series\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(RW2) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np5 <- forecast::ggAcf(RW2, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 + p4 + p5 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: White noise with drift as specified in Equation 4.3."

This is the condition under which AR(1) process is (weakly) stationary. E.g., if \\(\\phi_{1} = \\pm 1\\) then the process is a random walk and is also not stationary. We shall see later that all AR processes require some condition of this nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Check the stationarity of AR(1)\n\n\n\nCheck that the AR(1) process \\(Y_t\\) is stationary, given that \\(Y_t = \\phi Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\\), \\(|\\phi| < 1\\), and \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0, \\sigma^2)\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{E}(Y_t) &= \\mathrm{E}(\\phi Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t)\\\\\n& = \\phi \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-1}) + \\mathrm{E}(\\epsilon_t)\\\\\n& = \\phi^2 \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-2}) + 0\\\\\n& = \\phi^3 \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-3})\\\\\n& = \\dots\\\\\n& = \\phi^N \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-N})\\\\\n\\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{E}(Y_t) &= \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi^N \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-N}) = 0\n\\end{split}\n\\] Therefore, the mean of \\(Y_t\\) does not depend on time.\nNow check the autocovariance. For \\(h=0\\), \\(\\mathrm{cov}(Y_t, Y_{t}) = \\mathrm{var}(Y_t) = \\sigma^2_Y\\), which is derived in Equation 4.4 and does not depend on time.\nFor \\(h \\neq 0\\), \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{cov}(Y_t, Y_{t-h}) &= \\mathrm{cov}(\\phi Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t, Y_{t-h})\\\\\n& = \\mathrm{cov}(\\phi Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-h}) + \\mathrm{cov}(\\epsilon_t, Y_{t-h})\\\\\n& = \\phi \\mathrm{cov}(Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-h}) + 0\\\\\n& = \\phi \\mathrm{cov}(\\phi Y_{t-2} + \\epsilon_{t-1}, Y_{t-h})\\\\\n& = \\phi^2 \\gamma_Y(h-2)\\\\\n& = \\dots\\\\\n& = \\phi^h \\gamma_Y(0) \\\\\n& = \\phi^h \\sigma_Y^2,\n\\end{split}\n\\] thus the autocovariance does not depend on time, depends only on lag \\(h\\).\nBoth conditions for weak stationarity are satisfied, the \\(Y_t\\) specified above is weakly stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdditionally, see that the ACF of the AR(1) process \\[\n\\rho_Y(h) = \\frac{\\gamma_Y(h)}{\\gamma_Y(0)} = \\frac{\\phi^h \\gamma_Y(0)}{\\gamma_Y(0)} = \\phi^h\n\\tag{4.5}\\] shows exponential decay. Remember this about AR processes.\n\n\nAR(\\(p\\)) model\nNow we can extend our AR(1) model to \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_{t} &= \\phi_{1} Y_{t  - 1} + \\phi_{2} Y_{t - 2} + \\dots + \\phi_{p} Y_{t - p} + \\epsilon_{t} \\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^p\\phi_iY_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.6}\\] with \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) independent of \\(Y_{t - k}, \\dots , Y_{t - 1}\\); \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}^{+}\\). This model is called an autoregressive model of order \\(p\\), or simply an AR(\\(p\\)) model.\nSimilarly to AR(1), every AR(\\(p\\)) model may be rewritten as \\[\n\\left(1 -  \\sum^{p}_{i = 1} \\phi_{i} B^{i} \\right) Y_{t} = \\epsilon_{t},\n\\] or in more compact notation as \\[\n\\phi (B) Y_t = \\epsilon_t,\n\\] where \\(\\phi(\\lambda)\\) is the polynomial \\(\\phi(\\lambda) = 1 - \\phi_{1} \\lambda - \\phi_{2} \\lambda^{2} - \\dots - \\phi_{p} \\lambda^{p}\\).\nThe stationarity condition for AR(\\(p\\)) model is defined through the polynomial \\(\\phi(\\lambda)\\). Specifically, all the roots of the function \\(\\phi(\\lambda)\\) lie outside the unit circle in the complex plane.\nTo compute ACVF and ACF for the AR(\\(p\\)) model, multiplying both sides of Equation 4.6 by \\(Y_{t - k}\\) for \\(k \\geqslant p\\) and taking expectations yields \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{E} \\left( Y_{t} Y_{t - k} \\right) & =  \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\phi_{1} Y_{t-1} Y_{t-k} + \\phi_{2} Y_{t-2} Y_{t-k} + \\dots + \\phi_{p} Y_{t -p} Y_{t - k} + \\epsilon_{t} Y_{t -k} \\right) \\\\\n& =  \\phi_{1}  \\mathrm{E} \\left( Y_{t  - 1} Y_{t - k} \\right) + \\phi_{2} \\mathrm{E} \\left( Y_{t - 2} Y_{t - k} \\right) + \\dots+ \\phi_{p} \\mathrm{E} \\left(Y_{t - p} Y_{t - k} \\right) + \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\epsilon_{t} Y_{t  - k} \\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThus, we get autocovariances \\[\n\\gamma(k) = \\phi_{1}\\gamma(k -1) + \\phi_{2}\\gamma(k - 2) + \\dots + \\phi_{p} \\gamma(k  - p),\n\\] which turns into a mixed exponential decay of order \\(p\\) for the ACF \\[\n\\rho(k) = \\phi_{1} \\rho(k - 1) + \\phi_{2} \\rho(k - 2) + \\dots + \\phi_{p} \\rho(k - p).\n\\]\nTo identify the decay, we need the \\(p\\) starting correlations \\(\\rho(1), \\rho(2), \\dots, \\rho(p)\\), which we can find from the parameters \\(\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}, \\dots, \\phi_{p}\\).\nPACF of AR processes\nAn AR(\\(p\\)) model implies \\(Y_{t+h} = \\sum_{i=1}^p\\phi_{i} Y_{t + h - i} + \\epsilon_{t+h}\\), where the roots of \\(\\phi(\\lambda)\\) are outside the unit circle. When \\(h > p\\), the regression of \\(Y_{t+h}\\) on \\(\\{ Y_{t+1},\\dots, Y_{t+h-1}\\}\\) is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+h} = \\sum^p_{i=1} \\phi_i Y_{t+h-i}.\n\\] Thus, when \\(h > p\\), \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{hh} &= \\mathrm{cor}(Y_{t+h}-\\hat{Y}_{t+h}, Y_t - \\hat{Y}_t) \\\\\n& = \\mathrm{cor}(\\epsilon_{t+h}, Y_t - \\hat{Y}_t) \\\\\n& = 0,\n\\end{align}\n\\] because, by the causality of the process, the difference \\(Y_t - \\hat{Y}_t\\) depends only on \\(\\{ \\epsilon_{t+h-1}, \\epsilon_{t+h-2},\\dots \\}\\).\nWhen \\(h\\leqslant p\\), \\(\\rho_{hh}\\) is not zero, and \\(\\rho_{11}, \\dots, \\rho_{p-1,p-1}\\) are not necessarily zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe important conclusion is that the PACF of an AR(\\(p\\)) process necessarily cuts off (PACF = 0) after lag \\(p\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PACF of AR(1) process\n\n\n\nFor an AR(1) process, the best linear predictor \\(P(X_{n + 1} | X_n) = \\phi X_n\\).\nFor \\(h = 0\\), \\(\\rho_{00} = 1\\).\nFor \\(h = 1\\), \\(\\rho_{11} = \\mathrm{cor}(X_t, X_{t+1}) = \\phi\\) (no intermediate lags, see Equation 4.5).\nFor \\(h = 2\\), note that \\(X_{t+2} = \\phi X_{t+1} + \\epsilon_{t+2}\\), then \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{22} &= \\mathrm{cor}(X_t - P(X_t | X_{t+1}), X_{t+2} - P(X_{t+2} | X_{t+1})) \\\\\n&= \\mathrm{cor}(X_t - P(X_t | X_{t+1}), X_{t+2} - \\phi X_{t+1})\\\\\n&= \\mathrm{cor}(X_t - P(X_t | X_{t+1}), \\epsilon_{t+2})\\\\\n&= 0\n\\end{align}\n\\] because the term \\(X_t - P(X_t | X_{t+1})\\) is a function of \\(X_t\\) and \\(X_{t+1}\\) only, while \\(\\epsilon_{t+2}\\) is the future noise.\nThus, for \\(X_t \\sim\\) AR(1), the PACF \\[\n\\rho_{hh} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } h = 0\\\\\n\\phi & \\text{if } h = 1\\\\\n0 & \\text{if } h \\geqslant 2\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nSee the plots for the following AR(1) process in Figure 4.4: \\[\nX_t = \\phi_1 X_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t,\n\\tag{4.7}\\] where \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\), \\(\\phi_1=0.6\\), and \\(\\sigma = 1\\).\n\nCode# Theoretical ACF, PACF\nphi <- 0.6\nRHO <- phi^Lag\nALPHA <- c(1, phi, rep(0, max(Lag) - 1))\n\n# Sample data\nX <- arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 0, 0), ar = phi), n = T)\n\n# Plots\np1 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, ACF = RHO), aes(x = Lag, y = ACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, PACF = ALPHA), aes(x = Lag, y = PACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- forecast::autoplot(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample time series\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np5 <- forecast::ggAcf(X, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\n(plot_spacer() + p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4 + p5) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: AR(1) process as specified in Equation 4.7.\n\n\n\n\nSee the plots for the following AR(1) process in Figure 4.5 (only the coefficient \\(\\phi_1\\) changed from the previous specification): \\[\nX_t = \\phi_1 X_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t;\\; \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2);\\; \\phi_1=-0.6,\\; \\sigma = 1.\n\\tag{4.8}\\]\n\nCode# Theoretical ACF, PACF\nphi <- -0.6\nRHO <- phi^Lag\nALPHA <- c(1, phi, rep(0, max(Lag) - 1))\n\n# Sample data\nX <- arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 0, 0), ar = phi), n = T)\n\n# Plots\np1 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, ACF = RHO), aes(x = Lag, y = ACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, PACF = ALPHA), aes(x = Lag, y = PACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- forecast::autoplot(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample time series\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np5 <- forecast::ggAcf(X, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\n(plot_spacer() + p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4 + p5) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: AR(1) process as specified in Equation 4.8.\n\n\n\n\nACF of the AR(1) model takes two graphical forms depending on whether the coefficient \\(\\phi_{1}\\) is positive or negative. In the first case, the decay occurs through the positive axis only (Figure 4.4). In the second case, the decay alternates between the negative and positive axes (Figure 4.5). This is so-called mixed exponential decay. Although both forms are examples of exponential decay, they appear different visually.\nAs the order \\(p\\) of an AR(\\(p\\)) model increases, the number of different visual presentations of the ACF increases as well. The ACF of an AR(\\(p\\)) model can take \\(2^{p}\\) different graphical forms, depending on the signs (positive or negative) of the parameters \\(\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}, \\dots, \\phi_{p}\\). Thus, the ACF of an AR(2) model can take \\(2^{2} = 4\\) different graphical forms."

For an MA(\\(q\\)) process, \\(\\gamma(h) = 0\\) for all \\(h > q\\). Equivalently, the ACF has \\(q\\) ‘starting’ correlations or spikes, \\(\\rho(1), \\rho(2), \\dots, \\rho(q)\\), and then \\(\\rho(h) = 0\\) for \\(h > q\\).

The advantage of this method is that we do not have to memorize anything. Moreover, since white noise has the property that \\(\\mathrm{cov} (\\epsilon_{u}, \\epsilon_{v}) = 0\\) whenever \\(u \\neq v\\), interactions occur only when the time indices match up, i.e., only when \\(u = v\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: ACVF and ACF of MA(1)\n\n\n\nConsider an MA(1) model. Let \\(h \\geqslant 0\\). Applying the covariance properties we obtain the general expression: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\gamma(h) & = \\mathrm{cov}\\left( Y_{t}, Y_{t - h} \\right) \\\\\n& = \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t} + \\theta_{1} \\epsilon_{t - 1},\\; \\epsilon_{t - h} + \\theta_{1} \\epsilon_{t - h - 1}  \\right) \\\\\n& =  \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t},  \\epsilon_{t - h} \\right) + \\theta_{1} \\mathrm{cov} \\left(  \\epsilon_{t},  \\epsilon_{t - h - 1}  \\right) + \\theta_{1} \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t - 1}, \\epsilon_{t - h} \\right) + \\theta^{2}_{1} \\mathrm{cov} \\left(\\epsilon_{t - 1}, \\epsilon_{t - h - 1} \\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nNote that the covariances in the last line of the above expression will be nonzero if the time indices match up. By plugging different values of \\(h\\) into the above equation, we obtain \\[\n\\begin{align}\nh  =  0 \\rightarrow \\gamma(0) &= \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t}, \\epsilon_{t} \\right) + 0 + 0 + \\theta^{2}_{1} \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t - 1}, \\epsilon_{t - 1} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sigma^{2} + \\theta^{2}_{1} \\sigma^{2} \\\\\n&= \\sigma^{2} \\left( 1 + \\theta^{2}_{1} \\right). \\\\\n\\\\\nh = 1 \\rightarrow \\gamma(1) &= 0 + 0 + \\theta_{1} \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t - 1}, \\epsilon_{t - 1} \\right) + 0 \\\\\n&= \\sigma^{2} \\theta_{1}.\\\\\n\\\\\nh \\geqslant 2 \\rightarrow \\gamma(h) &= 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\\n&= 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis method generalizes easily to computing autocovariances for MA(\\(q\\)) models of higher orders.\nRecall that ACF is the ACVF standardized by the variance (which is the ACVF at lag zero), hence the ACF \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho(h) &= \\frac{\\gamma(h)}{\\gamma(0)} \\\\\n&=\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } h = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\theta_1}{1 + \\theta^2_1} & \\text{if } h = 1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } h > 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe have explicitly determined the structure of the ACF of an MA(\\(q\\)) process. Its most important feature is that \\(\\rho(h) = 0\\) for \\(h > q\\). Remember this about MA processes.\n\n\nFiner features, such as expressing the \\(\\rho(h)\\) in terms of the \\(\\theta_{r}\\) coefficients, can be determined as above.\nPACF of MA processes\nFor an MA(\\(q\\)), we can write \\(Y_t = -\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\pi_j Y_{t-j} + \\epsilon_t\\). Moreover, no finite representation exists. From this result, it should be apparent that the PACF will never cut off, as in the case of an AR(\\(p\\)). For an MA(1), \\(Y_t = \\epsilon_t +\\theta \\epsilon_{t-1}\\), with \\(|\\theta| < 1\\), it can be shown that (Shumway and Stoffer 2014): \\[\n\\rho_{hh} = - \\frac{(-\\theta)^h (1 - \\theta^2)}{1 - \\theta^{2(h+1)}}, \\; h \\geqslant 1.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEvery MA(\\(q\\)) process has an infinite autoregressive expansion and its PACF never cuts off. In fact, it can be shown that the PACF of an MA(\\(q\\)) process damps out according to a mixed exponential decay of order \\(q\\).\n\n\nWe do not have to compute the PACF by performing numerous regressions first. The computations are done via a recursive formula.\nSimilar to AR(1) examples above, now consider two sets of plots for MA(1) processes with a positive and negative coefficient.

Knowing the expected behavior of ACF and PACF for ARMA models (see Table 4.1), AR(2) can be suggested in this case, which is equivalent to ARMA(2,0).\nGiven the potential sample variability affecting the estimates of ACF and PACF, there could be other model specifications close to the selected one that may perform similarly or even slightly better when compared to the one selected based on the visual analysis. For example, we can check other suitable combinations within the maximal lag of 2 we identified: ARMA(1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (0,2), (1,2), and ARMA(2,2). With so many choices, we need some quantitative criteria to select the best model.\nThe code below uses a ‘manual’ approach of calculating Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) to select the model from the specified set, but see the next section for R functions that do it more automatically.\n\n# Combinations of p and q, without p = q = 0\nresults <- expand.grid(p = c(0, 1, 2), q = c(0, 1, 2))[-1, ] \nfor (i in 1:nrow(results)) {\n    mod <- arima(Y, order = c(results$p[i], 0, results$q[i]))\n    results$aic[i] <- mod$aic\n    results$bic[i] <- BIC(mod)\n}\nresults\n\n#>   p q aic bic\n#> 2 1 0 851 862\n#> 3 2 0 838 853\n#> 4 0 1 987 998\n#> 5 1 1 839 854\n#> 6 2 1 840 859\n#> 7 0 2 915 929\n#> 8 1 2 841 859\n#> 9 2 2 842 864\n\n\n\n4.7.1 Automatic model selection\nFor example, the function stats::ar() by default uses the Yule–Walker method to estimate the coefficients and AIC to select the best order for AR(\\(p\\)) model, where the maximum of \\(p\\) can be set by the user.\n\nar(Y, order.max = 11)\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> ar(x = Y, order.max = 11)\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>     1      2  \n#> 0.612  0.220  \n#> \n#> Order selected 2  sigma^2 estimated as  0.939\n\n\nThe function funtimes::ARest() is a wrapper for stats::ar(). It adds a difference-based estimator by Hall and Van Keilegom (2003), which is now used by default, and also switches to BIC as the model selection criterion. The selection is still done only for the order \\(p\\) in AR(\\(p\\)), without considering the possibility of MA terms.\n\nfuntimes::ARest(Y)\n\n#> [1] 0.571 0.176\n\n\nTo check the correspondence with stats::ar(), change the method and fix the ar.order (turn off its automatic selection):\n\nfuntimes::ARest(Y, ar.method = \"yw\", ar.order = 2, BIC = FALSE)\n\n#> [1] 0.612 0.220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBIC selects more parsimonious models than AIC does. Such simpler models are usually preferred for forecasting tasks.\n\n\nThe function fable::ARIMA() searches over possible ARMA models within some order constraints (the default maximal orders and search strategy are different from the two functions above – see help files for each function in R). This function is a successor of the function forecast::auto.arima() and is probably the most comprehensive R function for estimating and selecting ARMA models. It allows to fit and select not only ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) models, but also more complex models that will be described later in the course.\n\nlibrary(fable)\nm <- as_tsibble(Y) %>% \n    model(ARIMA(Y ~ 1, ic = \"bic\"))\nreport(m)\n\n#> Series: Y \n#> Model: ARIMA(2,0,0) w/ mean \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>          ar1     ar2  constant\n#>       0.6100  0.2184    0.0466\n#> s.e.  0.0562  0.0562    0.0545\n#> \n#> sigma^2 estimated as 0.9383:  log likelihood=-415\n#> AIC=838   AICc=838   BIC=853\n\n\nIn all considered cases the model ARMA(2,0), which is equivalent to AR(2), was selected.

    "section": "\n5.1 Introduction to ARIMA",
    "text": "5.1 Introduction to ARIMA\nWe have already discussed the class of ARMA models for representing stationary series. A generalization of this class, which incorporates a wide range of nonstationary series, is provided by the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) processes, i.e., processes which, after differencing finitely many times, reduce to ARMA processes.\nIf \\(d\\) is a nonnegative integer, then \\(X_t\\) is an ARIMA(\\(p, d, q\\)) process if \\(Y_t=(1 - B)^d X_t\\) is a causal ARMA(\\(p, q\\)) process. The process is stationary if \\(d = 0\\), in which case it reduces to an ARMA(\\(p, q\\)) process.\nFor example \\(X_t\\) is an ARIMA(1,1,0) process, then \\(Y_t\\) representing the series of its first-order differences (because \\(d = 1\\)) is an ARMA(1,0) process \\[\nY_t = (1 - B)X_t = \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + Z_t,\n\\] where \\(|\\phi_1| < 1\\) and \\(Z_t\\) is white noise.\nAn equation for ARIMA(\\(p, d, q\\)) is \\[\n(1 - B)^d (1 - \\phi_1B - \\dots - \\phi_pB^p)X_t =\n(1 + \\theta_1B + \\dots + \\theta_qB^q)Z_t,\n\\tag{5.1}\\] where \\(B\\) is the backshift operator, \\(d\\) is the order of differences, \\(\\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_p\\) are autoregression coefficients, \\(p\\) is the autoregressive order, \\(\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_q\\) are moving average coefficients, \\(q\\) is the moving average order, and \\(Z_t\\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0,\\sigma^2)\\). The left part of Equation 5.1 consists of the differences and the AR part; the right part represents the MA part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nModifications of Equation 5.1 exists, such as those having both the AR and MA parts on the right side. This affects the signs of estimated coefficients \\(\\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_p\\) and possibly \\(\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_q\\). Check the help files of the software to know the exact form of the model it is estimating.\n\n\nWhy the process is called ‘integrated’?\nRecall the geometric interpretation of the integral of a curve \\(y = f(x)\\) defined on continuous \\(x\\). The integral of \\(y\\) corresponds to the area under the curve. For example, if \\(y = f(x)\\) is a function describing income \\(y\\) based on working time \\(x\\), the integral corresponds to the total income in a certain period.\nIn our lectures, we deal with time series defined using discrete times \\(t\\) (for example, years), so yearly income is \\(Y_t\\), and the total income over several years can be obtained by summing the individual annual incomes, \\(\\sum Y_t\\). Hence, here we integrate by summation.\nRecall the definition of random walk series, which is a cumulative sum of i.i.d. noise: \\[\nX_t = \\sum_{i=1}^t Y_i,\n\\] where \\(Y_t \\sim\\) i.i.d.(\\(0,\\sigma^2\\)). This \\(X_t\\) is the simplest example of integrated series. The notation \\(X_t \\sim\\) I(1) means \\(X_t\\) is a first-order integrated series. The differences of \\(X_t\\) \\[\n\\begin{align}\n(1 - B)X_t &= X_t - BX_t \\\\\n&= X_t - X_{t-1} \\\\\n&= Y_t\n\\end{align}\n\\] give us back the uncorrelated series \\(Y_t\\), hence the process \\(X_t\\) is an ARIMA(0,1,0) process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nARIMA(\\(p, d, q\\)) processes with \\(d \\geqslant 1\\) are also called difference-stationary processes or processes with a stochastic trend. I.e., difference-stationary means the process is not stationary but can be made stationary by proper differencing."

We will first learn how to identify the number of differences (i.e., the order of differences \\(d\\)) by analyzing plots of the time series and ACF at each iteration of the method. In the later lecture on detecting trends in time series, we will also introduce formal tests for the integration order.\nBelow is a general algorithm used to fit ARIMA(\\(p, d, q\\)) models\n\nStart assuming \\(d = 0\\).\nPlot the time series and ACF.\nIf the plots suggest nonstationarity, iterate differencing and plotting to update \\(d\\):\n\nApply differences of the current time series, write \\(d = d + 1\\)\n\nPlot the time series and ACF\nIf nonstationarity is still obvious, repeat the differencing and plotting\n\n\nIdentify the orders \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) from the plots of ACF and PACF of the latest (differenced) time series.\nEstimate the model.\nApply model diagnostics, particularly for homogeneity, uncorrelatedness, and normality of residuals.

From Figure 5.2, there is no tendency in the differenced series, and the ACF declines fast, so we achieved stationarity and no need to difference the data more. Overall, we differenced the time series once to achieve stationarity, so the order of differences \\(d = 1\\).\n\nCodeX <- diff(iceoff)\np1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(X) +\n    xlab(\"Year\") +\n    ylab(\"diff(Ice breakup day)\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(X) +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- forecast::ggAcf(X, type = \"partial\") +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 / (p2 + p3) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Plots for the differenced time series of ice breakup days.\n\n\n\n\nContinue working with Figure 5.2 to identify the orders \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). If we treat the behavior of ACF as exhibiting a cut-off, and PACF having an exponential decay, an MA(\\(q\\)) model might be plausible (i.e., \\(p = 0\\)). Since the ACF cuts off after lag 1, \\(q = 1\\) in this case.\nHence, we specified the model for ice breakup dates to be ARIMA(0,1,1), which can be written as \\[\n(1 - B) Y_t = (1 + \\theta_1B)Z_t\n\\] or \\[\nY_t = Y_{t-1} + \\theta_1 Z_{t-1} + Z_t,\n\\] where \\(Y_t\\) represents the ice breakup dates in the year \\(t\\), \\(\\theta_1\\) is the moving average coefficient, and \\(Z_t\\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0,\\sigma^2)\\).\nWe can now estimate the model, for example, using stats::arima().\n\nmod_baikal <- stats::arima(iceoff, order = c(0, 1, 1))\nmod_baikal\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> stats::arima(x = iceoff, order = c(0, 1, 1))\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>          ma1\n#>       -0.843\n#> s.e.   0.075\n#> \n#> sigma^2 estimated as 59:  log likelihood = -519,  aic = 1042\n\n\nWe can also check the orders selected automatically:\n\nforecast::auto.arima(iceoff)\n\n#> Series: iceoff \n#> ARIMA(0,1,1) \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>          ma1\n#>       -0.843\n#> s.e.   0.075\n#> \n#> sigma^2 = 59.4:  log likelihood = -519\n#> AIC=1042   AICc=1043   BIC=1048\n\n\nIn the next step, we apply diagnostic checks for the residuals, for example, using plots (Figure 5.3). Remember that the residuals should resemble white noise.\n\nCodee <- mod_baikal$residuals\np1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(e) + \n    ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(e) +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- ggpubr::ggqqplot(e) + \n    xlab(\"Standard normal quantiles\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 / (p2 + p3) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Residual diagnostics for the ARIMA(0,1,1) model for ice breakup dates.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that the diagnostics plots show satisfactory behavior of the residuals (Figure 5.3), continue with forecasting using this model (Figure 5.4).

Even after the seasonal differences, there might be significant spikes at the seasonal lags in ACF and PACF, which can be addressed by selecting proper seasonal autoregressive and moving average orders. Therefore, we can define orders of integration, AR, and MA for the seasonal part of the time series in the same way we define these orders for the non-seasonal part.\nBased on the definitions in Brockwell and Davis (2002), \\(X_t\\) is a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, SARIMA(\\(p,d,q\\))(\\(P,D,Q\\))\\(_s\\) process if the differenced series \\(Y_t=(1 - B)^d (1 - B^s)^D X_t\\) is a causal ARMA process. Here \\(d\\) and \\(D\\) are nonnegative integers, and \\(s\\) is the period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn practice, \\(D \\leqslant 1\\) and \\(P, Q \\leqslant 3\\).\n\n\nAn equation for SARIMA(\\(p, d, q\\))(\\(P, D, Q\\))\\(_s\\) is \\[\n\\begin{split}\n(1 - B)^d (1 - \\phi_1B - \\dots - \\phi_pB^p) (1 - B^s)^D (1 - \\Phi_1B^s - \\dots - \\Phi_PB^{sP}) X_t \\\\\n= (1 + \\theta_1B + \\dots + \\theta_qB^q) (1 + \\Theta_1B^s + \\dots + \\Theta_QB^{sQ})Z_t,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.2}\\] where \\(D\\) is the order of seasonal differences, \\(\\Phi_1, \\dots, \\Phi_P\\) are the seasonal autoregression coefficients, \\(P\\) is the seasonal autoregressive order, \\(\\Theta_1, \\dots, \\Theta_q\\) are seasonal moving average coefficients, \\(Q\\) is the seasonal moving average order, and the rest of the terms are the same as in Equation 5.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: SARIMA for the number of airline passengers\n\n\n\nHere we revisit the time series on airline passengers from which we have removed the trend by taking regular non-seasonal differences once (\\(d = 1\\)). Notice from Figure 5.5 C and D how after taking the usual differences the upward trend disappeared, and ACF started to decay much faster. At the seasonal lags, however, the ACF decays still linearly (Figure 5.5 D), which suggested differencing at the seasonal lag to remove strong periodicity. After taking seasonal differences once (\\(D = 1\\)), the time series looks stationary (Figure 5.5 E), and the ACF decays fast at both seasonal and non-seasonal lags. This is enough differencing.\n\nCodeYt <- log10(AirPassengers)\n\n# Apply first-order (non-seasonal) differences\nD1 <- diff(Yt)\n\n# Additionally, apply first-order seasonal differences\nD1D12 <- diff(D1, lag = 12)\n\np1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(Yt) + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"lg(Air passangers)\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Yt\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(Yt) + \n    ggtitle(\"Yt\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np3 <- ggplot2::autoplot(D1) + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"lg(Air passangers)\") + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)Yt\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(D1) + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)Yt\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np5 <- ggplot2::autoplot(D1D12) + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"lg(Air passangers)\") + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)(1-B12)Yt\") +\n    theme_light()\np6 <- forecast::ggAcf(D1D12) + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)(1-B12)Yt\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\n(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4) / (p5 + p6) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Time series plot of the airline passenger series with an estimated ACF and the detrended (differenced) series with their ACFs.\n\n\n\n\nFor the next step, see Figure 5.6 to identify the orders \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). For that, look only at the non-seasonal lags, 1–11. Both ACF and PACF have significant values at lags 1 and 3, which could correspond to AR(3), MA(3), ARMA(1,1), or ARMA with higher orders. From these options ARMA(1,1) has fewer parameters, hence we prefer this model, with \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 1\\), as the most parsimonious option. (However, given that the correlations at lag 2 are not statistically significant, information criteria may penalize adding extra arguments and might prefer a more compact specification, AR(1) or MA(1).)\nNext, use Figure 5.6 again to identify orders \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). Now look only at the seasonal lags 12, 24, 36, etc. Both the ACF and PACF have significant values only on the first of those lags (lag 12), which could correspond to AR(1), MA(1), or ARMA(1,1) for the seasonal component. From these options, AR(1) and MA(1) are the most parsimonious so we should select one of them or use some numeric criterion to select the best model (e.g., information criterion like AIC or forecasting accuracy on a testing set).\n\nCodep6 <- forecast::ggAcf(D1D12, lag.max = 36) + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)(1-B12)Yt\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np7 <- forecast::ggAcf(D1D12, lag.max = 36, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"(1-B)(1-B12)Yt\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np6 + p7 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: ACF and PACF of the differenced airline passenger time series \\((1-B)(1-B^{12})Y_t\\).\n\n\n\n\nOverall, our analysis suggested that SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,0) or SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is a plausible model for this time series.

    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nIn contrast to the traditional time series analysis that focuses on modeling the conditional first moment, models of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) specifically take the dependency of the conditional second moment into modeling consideration and accommodate the increasingly important need to explain and model risk and uncertainty in, for example, financial time series.\nThe ARCH models were introduced in 1982 by Robert Engle to model varying (conditional) variance or volatility of time series. It is often found in economics that the larger values of time series also lead to larger instability (i.e., larger variances), which is termed (conditional) heteroskedasticity. Standard examples for demonstrating ARCH or GARCH effects are time series of stock prices, interest and foreign exchange rates, and even some environmental processes: high-frequency data on wind speed, energy production, air quality, etc. (see examples in Cripps and Dunsmuir 2003; Marinova and McAleer 2003; Taylor and Buizza 2004; Campbell and Diebold 2005). In 2003, Engle was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel for his work on ARCH models. Although it is not one of the prizes that Alfred Nobel established in his will in 1895, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize is referred to along with the other Nobel Prizes by the Nobel Foundation."

    "text": "6.2 Features of ARCH\nSince financial data typically have the autocorrelation coefficient close to 1 at lag 1 (e.g., the exchange rate between the US and Canadian dollar hardly changes from today to tomorrow), it is much more interesting and also more practically relevant to model the returns of a financial time series rather than the series itself. Let \\(Y_t\\) be a time series of stock prices. The returns \\(X_t\\) measure the relative changes in price and are typically defined as simple returns \\[\nX_t = \\frac{Y_t - Y_{t-1}}{ Y_{t-1} } = \\frac{Y_t}{ Y_{t-1} } - 1\n\\tag{6.1}\\] or logarithmic returns \\[\nX_t = \\ln Y_t - \\ln Y_{t-1}.\n\\tag{6.2}\\] The two forms are approximately the same, since \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\ln Y_t - \\ln Y_{t-1} &= \\ln \\left(\\frac{Y_{t}}{Y_{t-1}} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\ln \\left(\\frac{Y_{t-1} + Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\ln \\left(1 + \\frac{Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} \\right) \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{ Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}}{ Y_{t -1} }.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.3}\\] The approximation \\(\\ln(1+x) \\approx x\\) works when \\(x\\) is close to zero, which is true for many real-world financial problems. However, logarithmic returns are often preferred because in many applications their distribution is closer to normal compared to one of simple returns. Also, log returns have infinite support (from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\)) compared to simple returns that have a lower bound of \\(-1\\).\nFor an example calculation of log returns, see Figure 6.1.\n\nCode# Load data and calculate log returns\nCAD <- readr::read_csv(\"./data/CAD.csv\",\n                       na = \"Bank holiday\",\n                       skip = 11) %>% \n    filter(!is.na(USD)) %>% \n    mutate(lnR = c(NA, diff(log(USD)))) %>% \n    filter(!is.na(lnR))\n\np1 <- ggplot(CAD, aes(x = Date, y = USD)) + \n    geom_line() +\n    ylab(\"CAD per USD\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(CAD, aes(x = Date, y = lnR)) + \n    geom_line() +\n    ylab(\"Log return\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: CAD per USD daily noon exchange rates and log returns, from 2006-02-22 to 2016-02-22 (excluding bank holidays), obtained from Bank of Canada.\n\n\n\n\nRydberg (2000) summarizes some important stylized features of financial return series, which have been repeatedly observed in all kinds of assets including stock prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates:\n\n\nHeavy tails. The distribution of the returns \\(X_t\\) has tails heavier than the tails of a normal distribution.\n\nVolatility clustering. Large price changes occur in clusters. Indeed, often large price changes tend to be followed by large price changes, and periods of tranquility alternate with periods of high volatility.\n\nAsymmetry. There is evidence that the distribution of stock returns is slightly negatively skewed. One possible explanation could be that trades react more strongly to negative information than to positive information.\n\nAggregational Gaussianity. When the sampling frequency decreases, the central limit law sets in and the distribution of the returns over a long period tends toward a normal distribution.\n\nLong-range dependence. The returns themselves hardly show any autocorrelation, which, however, does not mean that they are independent. Both squared returns and absolute returns often exhibit persistent autocorrelations indicating possible long-memory dependence in those series.\n\nFigure 6.2 is the simplest check for the presence of ARCH effects: when the time series is not autocorrelated but is autocorrelated if squared.\n\nCodep1 <- forecast::ggAcf(CAD$lnR) +\n    ggtitle(\"Log returns\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(CAD$lnR^2) +\n    ggtitle(bquote('(Log returns)'^2)) +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: ACF of log returns and squared log returns for USD/CAD exchange.\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, see Figure 6.3 with similar plots for simulated i.i.d. series.\n\nCodeset.seed(1)\niid <- rnorm(nrow(CAD))\n\np1 <- forecast::ggAcf(iid) +\n    ggtitle(\"iid\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(iid^2) +\n    ggtitle(bquote('iid'^2)) +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: ACF of simulated i.i.d. \\(N(0,1)\\) series."

We write \\(X_{t} \\sim \\mathrm{GARCH}(p, q)\\).\nNotice the similarity between ARMA and GARCH models.\nThe parameters of ARCH/GARCH models are estimated using the method of conditional maximum likelihood. There exist several tests for ARCH/GARCH effects (e.g., analyzing time series and ACF plots, the Engle’s Lagrange multiplier test).\nThe approaches to selecting the orders \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) for GARCH include:\n\nVisual analysis of ACF and PACF of the squared time series and other residual diagnostics;\nVariations of information criteria such as AIC and BIC to account for the number of estimated parameters in the GARCH model (Brooks and Burke 2003);\nUsing GARCH(1,1) by following Hansen and Lunde (2005);\nUsing out-of-sample forecasts (comparing alternative model specifications on a testing set).\n\n\n6.3.1 Lagrange multiplier test\nThe Lagrange multiplier (LM) test is equivalent to an \\(F\\)-test for the significance of the least squares regression on squared values: \\[\nX^{2}_{t} = \\alpha_0  + \\alpha_1 X^{2}_{t-1} + \\dots + \\alpha_m X^{2}_{t-m} + e_t,\n\\tag{6.6}\\] where \\(e_t\\) denotes the error term, \\(m\\) is a positive integer, \\(t = m+1,\\dots,T\\), and \\(T\\) is the sample size (length of the time series).\nSpecifically, the null hypothesis is \\[\nH_0: \\alpha_1 = \\dots = \\alpha_m = 0.\n\\] Let the sum of squares total \\[\nSST = \\sum_{t=m+1}^T \\left( X_t^2 - \\overline{X_t^2} \\right) ^2,\n\\] where \\(\\overline{X_t^2}\\) is the sample mean of \\(X_t^2\\). The sum of squares of the errors \\[\nSSE = \\sum_{t=m+1}^T \\hat{e}_t^2,\n\\] where \\(\\hat{e}_t\\) is the least-squares residual of the linear regression (Equation 6.6).\nThen, the test statistic \\[\nF = \\frac{(SST - SSE)/m}{SSE/(T-2m-1)},\n\\tag{6.7}\\] which is asymptotically distributed under the null hypothesis as a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with \\(m\\) degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Testing ARCH effects in USD/CAD log returns\n\n\n\nWe have seen in Figure 6.2 the autocorrelation of squared log returns.

Few things to note here:\n\nthe model is ‘self-contained’ so we can just specify n.ahead for the number of steps to be predicted;\nGARCH models are typically applied to long time series, so the argument nx limits the length of the plotted observed time series (by default only the most recent 25% of observations are plotted);\nthe argument conf specifies the confidence level, then the conditional distribution from the model is used to compute critical values for the interval forecasts. Alternatively, one can specify the critical values manually with the argument crit_val.\n\nFor more details, see ?fGarch::predict.\n\nCodepredict(garch11t, n.ahead = 30, \n        conf = 0.95,\n        plot = TRUE)\n\n#>    meanForecast meanError standardDeviation lowerInterval upperInterval\n#> 1      -3.2e-05   0.00445           0.00445      -0.00892       0.00885\n#> 2      -3.2e-05   0.00446           0.00446      -0.00894       0.00888\n#> 3      -3.2e-05   0.00448           0.00448      -0.00896       0.00890\n#> 4      -3.2e-05   0.00449           0.00449      -0.00899       0.00892\n#> 5      -3.2e-05   0.00450           0.00450      -0.00901       0.00895\n#> 6      -3.2e-05   0.00451           0.00451      -0.00903       0.00897\n#> 7      -3.2e-05   0.00452           0.00452      -0.00906       0.00899\n#> 8      -3.2e-05   0.00453           0.00453      -0.00908       0.00902\n#> 9      -3.2e-05   0.00455           0.00455      -0.00910       0.00904\n#> 10     -3.2e-05   0.00456           0.00456      -0.00913       0.00906\n#> 11     -3.2e-05   0.00457           0.00457      -0.00915       0.00908\n#> 12     -3.2e-05   0.00458           0.00458      -0.00917       0.00911\n#> 13     -3.2e-05   0.00459           0.00459      -0.00919       0.00913\n#> 14     -3.2e-05   0.00460           0.00460      -0.00921       0.00915\n#> 15     -3.2e-05   0.00461           0.00461      -0.00924       0.00917\n#> 16     -3.2e-05   0.00462           0.00462      -0.00926       0.00919\n#> 17     -3.2e-05   0.00463           0.00463      -0.00928       0.00922\n#> 18     -3.2e-05   0.00464           0.00464      -0.00930       0.00924\n#> 19     -3.2e-05   0.00466           0.00466      -0.00932       0.00926\n#> 20     -3.2e-05   0.00467           0.00467      -0.00934       0.00928\n#> 21     -3.2e-05   0.00468           0.00468      -0.00937       0.00930\n#> 22     -3.2e-05   0.00469           0.00469      -0.00939       0.00932\n#> 23     -3.2e-05   0.00470           0.00470      -0.00941       0.00934\n#> 24     -3.2e-05   0.00471           0.00471      -0.00943       0.00936\n#> 25     -3.2e-05   0.00472           0.00472      -0.00945       0.00938\n#> 26     -3.2e-05   0.00473           0.00473      -0.00947       0.00940\n#> 27     -3.2e-05   0.00474           0.00474      -0.00949       0.00942\n#> 28     -3.2e-05   0.00475           0.00475      -0.00951       0.00945\n#> 29     -3.2e-05   0.00476           0.00476      -0.00953       0.00947\n#> 30     -3.2e-05   0.00477           0.00477      -0.00955       0.00949\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Predictions using the GARCH(1,1) model for the USD/CAD log returns."

    "text": "7.3 Bootstrap enhancements\n\n7.3.1 Introduction to bootstrap\nWhen some of the statistical assumptions are violated, we may switch to using other methods or try to accommodate these violations by modifying part of the existing method.\n\nOne of the assumptions of Pearson correlation analysis is the absence of outliers. When outliers are in the data, we can opt for using Spearman correlations based on ranks, not the actual values. Thus, here we switch the method.\nWe often use the normal distribution for inference about the population mean because we assume that averages of independent samples coming from the same population are distributed normally. The normal approximation is true for large samples or for small samples if the underlying population is close to being normally distributed. So what happens if we have a small sample from a non-normal population? We do not know the distributional law under which sample means are distributed in this case, but we can approximate it using bootstrap.\n\nThe seminal paper by Efron (1979) describes bootstrap for i.i.d. data. In two words, the idea is the following: we can relax distributional assumptions and reconstruct the distribution of the sample statistic by resampling data with replacement and recalculating the statistic over and over. The resampling step will give us ‘new’ cases of collected samples, while the statistics calculated multiple times will let us approximate the distribution of the parameter of interest in this case of violated distributional assumption.\nLet \\(x_i\\) (\\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\)) be sample values collected from a non-normally distributed population using simple random sampling. If the sample size \\(n\\) is small, we cannot be sure that the distribution of sample averages \\(\\bar{x}\\) is normal, so we will approximate it using the following bootstrapping steps:\n\nLet \\(x^*_i\\) (\\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\)) be a sample with a replacement from the original sample \\(x_i\\). This is a way for us, without knowing the underlying distribution of the population and without collecting new data, to get a new artificial sample from the population.\nCalculate the mean (or another statistic of interest) from the bootstrapped data. For example, \\(\\bar{x}^* = n^{-1} \\sum x^*_i\\) is the bootstrapped mean.\nRepeat the steps above a large number of times to obtain a distribution of the statistics \\(\\bar{x}^*_1, \\dots, \\bar{x}^*_B\\), where \\(B\\) is the number of bootstrap replications. This is so-called bootstrapped distribution.\nFinally, we use the bootstrapped distribution for the intended analysis. Typically it involves calculating confidence intervals. There are a few ways the intervals can be calculated (see Davison and Hinkley 1997), some of the methods provide symmetric intervals, while others do not. Probably the simplest is the percentile confidence interval, which computes the \\(\\alpha/2\\)th and \\((1-\\alpha/2)\\)th quantiles of the bootstrapped distribution, to get an interval for confidence \\(1 - \\alpha\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Bootstrap confidence interval for the population mean\n\n\n\nConsider a small sample of mercury (Hg) concentrations in fish tissue (Lyubchich et al. 2016). These observations do not constitute a time series; the data were collected in such a way that we can treat the samples as independent. Figure 7.2 A shows that the underlying population of Hg concentrations is likely not normally distributed, so we will use bootstrapping to calculate a confidence interval for the mean.\n\nCode# Mercury concentrations\nHg <- c(10.159162, 9.190562, 7.776279, 11.417387, 8.494544, \n        9.948271, 7.865391, 7.412350, 8.112304, 7.541787)\n\n# Set seed for reproducible bootstrapping\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Number of bootstrap replications\nB = 1000\n\n# Significance level\nalpha = 0.05\n\n# Compute bootstrapped means (option 1)\nxbar_star <- numeric()\nfor (b in 1:B) {\n    # bootstrapped sample\n    Hgstar <- sample(Hg, replace = TRUE)\n    # bootstrapped mean\n    xbar_star[b] <- mean(Hgstar)\n}\n\n# Compute bootstrapped means (option 2)\nxbar_star <- sapply(1:B, function(b) mean(sample(Hg, replace = TRUE)))\n\n# Bootstrap percentile interval for confidence 1 - alpha\ninterval <- quantile(xbar_star, probs = c(alpha/2, 1 - alpha/2))\ninterval\n\n#>  2.5% 97.5% \n#>  8.04  9.64\n\n\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = Hg), aes(x = x)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), \n                   boundary = floor(min(Hg)), binwidth = 1, \n                   fill = \"grey50\") +\n    xlab(\"Hg (ng/g)\") + \n    ylab(\"Density\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Hg observations\") + \n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = xbar_star), aes(x = x)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 15, fill = \"grey50\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = interval, lty = 2) +\n    xlab(\"Hg (ng/g)\") + \n    ylab(\"Density\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Bootstrapped means\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Histograms of the original data and bootstrapped means. The dashed lines denote the bootstrap confidence interval for the mean.\n\n\n\n\nThe calculated confidence interval can be used in hypothesis testing. Note that the package boot provides functions with other options.\n\n\nWe cannot apply the outlined bootstrapping directly to time series or spatial data because these data are not i.i.d. and resampling will break the order and dependence structure. To account for the dependence structure, some modifications to the bootstrap procedure were proposed, including block bootstrap and sieve bootstrap (see Bühlmann 2002 and references therein).\nIn short, the first step of the outlined bootstrapping algorithm should preserve the dependence structure of the time series so that the generated bootstrapped samples correspond to the violation case that we want to accommodate in our analysis. For example, if we want to accommodate serial dependence in the \\(t\\)-test, the bootstrapped time series should be still autocorrelated, so we can approximate the distribution of the test statistic when the assumption of independence is violated.\n\n7.3.2 Bootstrapped \\(t\\)-test and Mann–Kendall test\nNoguchi et al. (2011) enhanced the classical \\(t\\)-test and Mann–Kendall trend test with sieve bootstrap approaches that take into account the serial correlation of data to obtain more accurate and reliable estimates. While taking into account the dependence structure in the data, these tests are still limited to the linear or monotonic case:\n\\(H_0\\): no trend\\(H_1\\): linear trend (\\(t\\)-test) or monotonic trend (Mann–Kendall test)\nApply the sieve-bootstrapped tests to our time series data, using the package funtimes:\n\nfuntimes::notrend_test(Y, ar.method = \"yw\")\n\n#> \n#>  Sieve-bootstrap Student's t-test for a linear trend\n#> \n#> data:  Y\n#> Student's t value = 2, p-value = 0.1\n#> alternative hypothesis: linear trend.\n#> sample estimates:\n#> $AR_order\n#> [1] 1\n#> \n#> $AR_coefficients\n#> phi_1 \n#> 0.344\n\nfuntimes::notrend_test(Y, test = \"MK\", ar.method = \"yw\")\n\n#> \n#>  Sieve-bootstrap Mann--Kendall's trend test\n#> \n#> data:  Y\n#> Mann--Kendall's tau = 0.1, p-value = 0.2\n#> alternative hypothesis: monotonic trend.\n#> sample estimates:\n#> $AR_order\n#> [1] 1\n#> \n#> $AR_coefficients\n#> phi_1 \n#> 0.344\n\n\nNotice the different \\(p\\)-values from the first time we applied the tests."

Hence, we can consider \\(\\sqrt{n}(\\rm{MST}-\\rm{MSE})\\) instead of \\(\\sqrt{n}(F_n-1)\\).\nLyubchich et al.

    "text": "7.5 Unit roots\nBy now, we have been identifying the order of integration (if a process \\(X_t \\sim\\) I(\\(d\\))) by looking at the time series plot of \\(X_t\\) and (largely) by looking at the plot of sample ACF. We differenced time series again and again until we saw a stable mean in the time series plot and a rapid (compared with linear), exponential-like decline in ACF. Here, we present a hypothesis testing approach originally suggested by Dickey and Fuller (1979) (Dickey–Fuller test).\nLet \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) be observations from an AR(1) model: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nX_t-\\mu & =\\phi_1(X_{t-1}-\\mu) + Z_t, \\\\\nZ_t &\\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0,\\sigma^2),\n\\end{split}\n\\] where \\(|\\phi_1|<1\\) and \\(\\mu=\\mathrm{E}X_t\\). For a large sample size \\(n\\), the maximum likelihood estimator \\(\\hat{\\phi_1}\\) of \\(\\phi_1\\) is approximately \\(N(\\phi_1, (1-\\phi^2_1)/n)\\). However, for the unit root case, this approximation is not valid! Thus, do not be tempted to use the normal approximation to construct a confidence interval for \\(\\phi_1\\) and check if it includes the value 1. Instead, consider a model that assumes a unit root (\\(H_0\\): unit root is present) and immediately removes it by differencing: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\Delta X_t = X_t - X_{t-1} &= \\phi^*_0 + \\phi^*_1X_{t-1}+Z_t,\\\\\nZ_t & \\sim {\\rm WN}(0,\\sigma^2),\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{7.2}\\] where \\(\\phi^*_0=\\mu(1-\\phi_1)\\) and \\(\\phi_1^*=\\phi_1 -1\\). Let \\(\\hat{\\phi}_1^*\\) be the OLS estimator of \\(\\phi_1^*\\), with its standard error estimated as \\[\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}\\left( \\hat{\\phi}_1^* \\right)\n= S\\left( \\sum_{t=2}^n \\left(X_{t-1}-\\bar{X} \\right)^2 \\right)^{-1/2},\n\\] where \\(S^2=\\sum_{t=2}^n\\left( \\Delta X_t - \\hat{\\phi}_0^* - \\hat{\\phi}_1^*X_{t-1}\\right)^2/(n-3)\\) and \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean. Dickey and Fuller (1979) derived the limit distribution of the test statistic \\[\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mu}=\\frac{\\hat{\\phi}_1^*}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}\\left( \\hat{\\phi}_1^* \\right)},\n\\] so we know the critical levels from this distribution (the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 quantiles are \\(-3.43\\), \\(-2.86\\), and \\(-2.57\\), respectively) and can test the null hypothesis of \\(\\phi_1^*=0\\) (notice the similarity with the usual \\(t\\)-test for significance of regression coefficients). An important thing to remember is that the \\(H_0\\) here assumes a unit root (nonstationarity).\nFor a more general AR(\\(p\\)) model, statistic \\(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mu}\\) has a similar form (the \\(\\phi_1^*\\) is different: \\(\\phi_1^* = \\sum_{i=1}^p\\phi_i -1\\)), and the test is then called the Augmented Dickey–Fuller test (ADF test). The order \\(p\\) can be specified in advance or selected automatically using AIC or BIC.\nAnother popular test for unit roots, the Phillips–Perron test (PP test), is built on the ADF test and considers the same null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: ADF test applied to simulated data\n\n\n\nSimulate a time series \\(Y_t \\sim\\) I(2) and apply the rule of thumb approach of taking differences (Figure 7.3).

That is, unit root tests cannot distinguish highly persistent stationary processes from nonstationary processes very well. Also, the power of unit root tests diminishes as deterministic terms are added to the test regressions. Tests that include a constant and trend in the test regression have less power than tests that only include a constant in the test regression."

    "text": "7.6 Conclusion\nTemporal dependence of time series is the most violated assumption of classical tests often employed for detecting trends, including the nonparametric Mann–Kendall test. However, multiple workarounds exist that allow the analyst to relax (avoid) the assumption of independence and provide more reliable inference. We have implemented sieve bootstrapping for time series as one such workaround.\nTest results depend on the specified alternative hypothesis. Remember that non-rejection of the null hypothesis doesn’t make it automatically true.\nWhen testing for unit roots (integration) in time series, the null hypothesis of ADF and PP tests is the unit root, while the alternative is the stationarity of the tested series. Iterative testing and differencing can be used to identify the order of integration \\(d\\).\n\n\n\n\nBickel PJ, Götze F, Zwet WR van (1997) Resampling fewer than \\(n\\) observations: Gains, losses, and remedies for losses.

    "text": "8.1 Spurious correlation\nResults of statistical analysis (correlation, regression, etc.) are called spurious when they are likely driven not by the underlying mechanisms such as the physical relationships between variables, but by matching patterns (often, temporal patterns) of the variables leading to the statistical significance of tested relationships. Such matching patterns include trends, periodic fluctuations (seasonality), and more random patterns like spikes matching in several time series, for example, detected by searching over a large database of time series (a.k.a. cherry picking).\n\nCodeset.seed(123)\nT <- 300\nXt <- ts(rnorm(T))\nYt <- ts(rnorm(T))\np1 <- forecast::autoplot(Xt) +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::autoplot(Yt) +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Original stationary and independent time series.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1 shows two series of length \\(T = 300\\) simulated from the standard normal distribution, \\(N(0,1)\\). These are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables: each of the \\(T\\) values in \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) was drawn independently from other values from the same distribution. Two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other. Independence is a strong condition, it also implies (includes) that the values are not correlated. This is true both for the values within the series \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\), and across \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) (i.e., \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) are not autocorrelated, nor correlated with each other). This is the asymptotic property of such a time series (as the sample size increases infinitely).\nIn finite samples, we may observe that a point estimate of the correlation coefficient even for such an ideal series is not exactly zero, but it will be usually not statistically significant. See the results (confidence interval and \\(p\\)-value) from the correlation \\(t\\)-test below:\n\ncor.test(Xt, Yt)\n\n#> \n#>  Pearson's product-moment correlation\n#> \n#> data:  Xt and Yt\n#> t = -1, df = 298, p-value = 0.3\n#> alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n#> 95 percent confidence interval:\n#>  -0.1727  0.0529\n#> sample estimates:\n#>     cor \n#> -0.0607\n\n\nNot many time series behave like that in real life – often we observe some trends. Let’s add linear trends to our simulated data, for example, trends going in the same direction but with slopes of different magnitudes. Here we use linear increasing trends, i.e., with positive slopes Figure 8.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is probably a good idea to refrain from writing ‘positive trends’ (or ‘negative trends’) because they can be confused with ‘good’ or ‘beneficial’ trends. For example, a decrease in the unemployment rate is a positive (good) trend for a country, but it is a trend with a negative slope. Contrary, a linear trend in pollutant concentrations with a positive slope (going upward) shows a negative (worsening) tendency for the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nCodeXt <- Xt + c(1:T)/95\nYt <- Yt + c(1:T)/50\np1 <- forecast::autoplot(Xt) +\n    ylim(-2, 8) +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::autoplot(Yt) +\n    ylim(-2, 8) +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Time series with trends.\n\n\n\n\nAfter adding trends to each of the time series, the correlation of \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) is strong and statistically significant, but this is not necessarily because these series are so strongly related to each other.\n\ncor.test(Xt, Yt)\n\n#> \n#>  Pearson's product-moment correlation\n#> \n#> data:  Xt and Yt\n#> t = 13, df = 298, p-value <2e-16\n#> alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n#> 95 percent confidence interval:\n#>  0.519 0.665\n#> sample estimates:\n#>   cor \n#> 0.597\n\n\nSome other factors may be driving the dynamics (trends) of \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) in the same direction. Also, recall the general formula for computing correlation (or autocorrelation) of time series and that we need to subtract time-dependent means (not just a mean calculated over the whole period assuming the mean is not changing or time-independent), for example, as in Equation 2.5.\nFor example, a city’s growing population may result in more police officers and heavier pollution at the same time, partially because more people will drive their vehicles in the city. An attempt to correlate (regress) pollution with the number of police officers will produce a so-called spurious correlation (regression). The results of statistical tests will be likely statistically significant. However, is pollution directly related to the number of police officers? Will the dismissal of a police officer help to make the air cleaner?\nNot only common increasing/decreasing trends but also other systematic changes (such as seasonality) may be responsible for spurious correlation effects. For example, both high ice cream sales and harmful algal blooms typically occur in warm weather conditions and may be ‘significantly’ correlated, suggesting banning ice cream for the sake of a safer environment. See more interesting examples of spurious correlation at http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations.\nSometimes, some simple tricks may help to avoid spurious results. For example, analyze not the raw numbers, but the rates that remove the effect of population growth in a city: crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants, number of people older than 70 per 1,000 inhabitants, etc. For more general approaches, see the next section."

Notice, the coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) is not statistically significant, what we expected.\n\n8.2.2 Use deviations from trends\nHere we fit a separate time trend (may be of a different form for each time series: linear, quadratic, log, etc.) for each variable and find deviations from these trends. Based on Figure 8.2, linear trends are appropriate here: \\[\nY_t = a_0 + a_1t + e_{(Y)t}; \\quad X_t = b_0 + b_1t + e_{(X)t},\n\\] where \\(e_{(Y)t}\\) and \\(e_{(X)t}\\) are the trend residuals for the series \\(Y_t\\) and \\(X_t\\), respectively.\nAfter the trend coefficients \\(a_0\\), \\(a_1\\), \\(b_0\\), and \\(b_1\\) are estimated,\n\nMY <- lm(Yt ~ t)\nMX <- lm(Xt ~ t)\n\nthe smoothed series are \\[\n\\widetilde{Y}_t = \\hat{a}_0 + \\hat{a}_1t; \\quad \\widetilde{X}_t = \\hat{b}_0 + \\hat{b}_1t\n\\] and the estimated trend residuals are (Figure 8.3) \\[\n\\hat{e}_{(Y)t} = Y_t - \\widetilde{Y}_t\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\hat{e}_{(X)t} = X_t - \\widetilde{X}_t.\n\\]\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(as.ts(MY$resid)) +\n    xlab(\"t\") +\n    ylab(\"eYt\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot2::autoplot(as.ts(MX$resid)) +\n    xlab(\"t\") +\n    ylab(\"eXt\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Residuals from individually estimated linear trends.\n\n\n\n\nUse the residuals in our regression model in place of the original variables: \\[\n\\hat{e}_{(Y)t} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\hat{e}_{(X)t} + \\epsilon_t.\n\\]\n\nmod_devTrend <- lm(MY$residuals ~ MX$residuals)\nsummary(mod_devTrend)\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = MY$residuals ~ MX$residuals)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n#> -2.7564 -0.6069  0.0546  0.6404  2.5802 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>               Estimate Std.

Again, it is a reasonable result based on how the time series were simulated (independent, although with trends in the same direction).\n\n8.2.3 Use differenced series\nInstead of assuming a deterministic trend as in the previous subsections, we can try to eliminate a stochastic trend by differencing the time series. We define the lag-1 difference operator \\(\\Delta\\) by \\[\n\\Delta X_t = X_t - X_{t-1} = (1-B)X_t,\n\\] where \\(B\\) is the backward shift operator, \\(BX_t = X_{t-1}\\).\nThere are tests developed in econometrics to find the appropriate order of differences (unit-root tests). Here, however, we will use the rule of thumb: for time trends looking linear (our case, see Figure 8.2) use the first-order differences, for parabolic shapes – the second-order differences. After differencing, the series should look stationary.\nThe first-order differences for our series (Figure 8.4) can be calculated as follows:\n\nD1X <- diff(Xt)\nD1Y <- diff(Yt)\n\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(D1Y) +\n    xlab(\"t\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot2::autoplot(D1X) +\n    xlab(\"t\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: First-order differences of the time series.\n\n\n\n\nThe series of first-order differences look stationary (Figure 8.4). Use these differenced series instead of the original time series in a regression model: \\[\n\\Delta Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\Delta X_t + \\epsilon_t.\n\\]\n\nmod_diff <- lm(D1Y ~ D1X)\nsummary(mod_diff)\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = D1Y ~ D1X)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n#> -4.056 -1.050  0.178  1.005  5.028 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>             Estimate Std.

This could be such a model: \\[\nY_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_t + \\epsilon_t.\n\\]\n\nbadModel <- lm(Yt ~ Xt)\nsummary(badModel)\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = Yt ~ Xt)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n#> -4.022 -1.020  0.098  1.219  4.091 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>             Estimate Std.

    "text": "8.3 Cointegration\nGenerally, cointegration might be characterized by two or more I(1) variables indicating a common long-run development, i.e., the variables do not drift away from each other except for transitory fluctuations. This defines a statistical equilibrium that, in empirical analysis, can often be interpreted as a long-run [economic] relation.\nIn other words, two I(1) series \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) are cointegrated if their linear combination \\(u_t\\) is I(0): \\[\nY_t - \\beta X_t = u_t.\n\\tag{8.3}\\]\nCointegration means a common stochastic trend. The vector \\((1, -\\beta)^{\\top}\\) is called the cointegration vector.\n\n8.3.1 Two-step Engle–Granger method\n\nEstimate long-run relationship, i.e., regression in levels as in Equation 8.3, and test residuals for I(0).\nIf the residual series \\(u_t\\) is I(0), use it in error correction model (ECM) regression \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\Delta Y_t &= a_0 -\\gamma_Y(Y_{t-1}-\\beta X_{t-1})+\\sum_{j=1}^{n_X}a_{Xj}\\Delta X_{t-j}+\\sum_{j=1}^{n_Y}a_{Yj}\\Delta Y_{t-j} + u_{Y,t},\\\\\n\\Delta X_t &= b_0 +\\gamma_X(Y_{t-1}-\\beta X_{t-1})+\\sum_{j=1}^{k_X}b_{Xj}\\Delta X_{t-j}+\\sum_{j=1}^{k_Y}b_{Yj}\\Delta Y_{t-j} + u_{X,t},\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{8.4}\\] where \\(u_X\\) and \\(u_Y\\) are pure random processes. If \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) are cointegrated, at least one \\(\\gamma_i\\), \\(i = X, Y\\), has to be different from zero.\n\nOLS estimator is super consistent, convergence \\(T\\). However, OLS can be biased in small samples.\nThe representation in Equation 8.4 has the advantage that it only contains stationary variables, although the underlying relation is between nonstationary (I(1)) variables. Thus, if the variables are cointegrated and the cointegration vector is known, the traditional statistical procedures can be applied for estimation and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Error correction model for simulated data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrate the analysis using simulated time series (Figure 8.9).\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(Xt) +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot2::autoplot(Yt) +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: Simulated I(1) time series.\n\n\n\n\nApply unit-root test to check the integration order of each series, using the R package tseries:\n\ntseries::adf.test(Xt)\n\n#> \n#>  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n#> \n#> data:  Xt\n#> Dickey-Fuller = -2, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.5\n#> alternative hypothesis: stationary\n\ntseries::adf.test(diff(Xt))\n\n#> \n#>  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n#> \n#> data:  diff(Xt)\n#> Dickey-Fuller = -7, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\n#> alternative hypothesis: stationary\n\ntseries::adf.test(Yt)\n\n#> \n#>  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n#> \n#> data:  Yt\n#> Dickey-Fuller = -2, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.5\n#> alternative hypothesis: stationary\n\ntseries::adf.test(diff(Yt))\n\n#> \n#>  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n#> \n#> data:  diff(Yt)\n#> Dickey-Fuller = -8, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\n#> alternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nWith the confidence of 95%, the ADF test results show that each of the time series, \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\), are I(1).

Hence, our models may include lagged versions of both the response and predictor variables (a general form of such a model was given in Equation 2.2)."

    "section": "\n9.2 Linear regression with ARMA errors",
    "text": "9.2 Linear regression with ARMA errors\nWe begin with the simplest case, a constant mean model, where the residuals are serially correlated and follow an AR(1) model, that is \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\tag{9.1}\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{t} \\sim\\) AR(1), i.e., \\[\n\\epsilon_{t} = \\phi \\epsilon_{t - 1} + a_{t}.\n\\tag{9.2}\\]\nHere \\(\\phi\\) is a real number satisfying \\(0 < |\\phi| < 1\\); \\(a_{t}\\) is white noise with zero mean and the variance \\(\\nu^{2}\\), i.e., \\(a_{t} \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0,\\nu^2)\\). We also assume that \\(\\mathrm{cov}(a_{t}, \\epsilon_{s}) = 0\\) for all \\(s < t\\) (i.e., that the residuals \\(\\epsilon_s\\) are not correlated with the future white noise \\(a_t\\)).\nEquation 9.2 allows us to express Equation 9.1 as \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\phi \\epsilon_{t - 1} + a_{t}.\n\\tag{9.3}\\]\nThe advantage of this representation is that the new residuals \\(a_{t}\\) satisfy the OLS assumptions. In particular, since \\(a_{t}\\) is white noise, \\(a_{t}\\) is homoskedastic and uncorrelated.\nWe shall also assume that \\(a_{t}\\) are normally distributed (for justification of the construction of confidence intervals and prediction intervals). However, even if \\(a_{t}\\) are not normal, \\(a_{t}\\) are uncorrelated, which is a big improvement over the serially correlated \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\).\nOur goal is to remove the \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) entirely from the constant mean model and replace them with \\(a_{t}\\) acting as new residuals. This can be done as follows. First, write Equation 9.1 for \\(t-1\\) and multiply both sides by \\(\\phi\\), \\[\n\\phi Y_{t -1} = \\phi \\beta_{0} + \\phi \\epsilon_{t - 1}.\n\\tag{9.4}\\]\nTaking the difference (Equation 9.3 minus Equation 9.4) eliminates \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) from the model: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_{t} - \\phi Y_{t - 1} &= \\left( \\beta_{0} + \\phi \\epsilon_{t - 1} + a_{t} \\right) - \\left( \\phi \\beta_{0} + \\phi \\epsilon_{t - 1}  \\right) \\\\\n&= (1 - \\phi) \\beta_{0} + a_{t}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTherefore we can rewrite the constant mean model in Equation 9.1 as \\[\nY_{t} = (1 - \\phi) \\beta_{0} + \\phi Y_{t - 1} + a_{t}.\n\\tag{9.5}\\]\nIn general, for any multiple linear regression \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\sum^{k}_{j =1} \\beta_{j} X_{t,j} + \\epsilon_{t}, ~~  \\text{where} ~~ \\epsilon_{t} \\sim \\mbox{AR(1)},\n\\tag{9.6}\\] we can perform a similar procedure of eliminating \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\).\nThis elimination procedure leads to the alternate expression \\[\nY_{t} = (1 - \\phi) \\beta_{0} + \\phi Y_{t -1} + \\sum^{k}_{j = 1} \\beta_{j} (X_{t,j} - \\phi X_{t-1, j}) + a_{t},\n\\tag{9.7}\\] where \\(a_{t}\\) is white noise, i.e., homoskedastic with constant (zero) mean and uncorrelated. See Appendix B describing the method of generalized least squares and an example of \\(k=1\\).\nNote that rewriting the model in this way pulls the autocorrelation parameter for the old residuals, \\(\\phi\\), into the regression part of the model. Thus there are now \\(k + 2\\) unknown regression parameters (\\(\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, \\dots, \\beta_{k}\\), and \\(\\phi\\)). The introduction of an additional parameter into the regression part of the model can be regarded as the price to be paid for extracting new residuals \\(a_{t}\\) that satisfy the OLS assumptions.\nNote that the new residuals \\(a_{t}\\) have smaller variance than the \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\). In fact, \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\sigma^{2} & = \\mbox{var} (\\epsilon_{t} ) = \\mbox{var} (\\phi \\epsilon_{t - 1} + a_{t}) \\\\\n\\\\\n& =  \\phi^{2} \\mbox{var}(\\epsilon_{t - 1}) + \\mbox{var} (a_{t} ) ~~~ \\mbox{since} ~~ \\mbox{cov}(a_{t}, \\epsilon_{t - 1}) = 0\\\\\n\\\\\n& = \\phi^{2}\\sigma^{2}  + \\nu^{2},\n\\end{split}\n\\] leading to the relation \\[\n\\nu^{2} = \\sigma^{2} (1 - \\phi^{2} ).\n\\tag{9.8}\\]\nHowever, comparing Equation 9.5 with Equation 9.5, and Equation 9.7 with Equation 9.6, we see that the rewritten form of the model is not linear in terms of the parameters \\(\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, \\dots, \\beta_{k}\\) and \\(\\phi\\). For example, the intercept term \\((1 - \\phi) \\beta_{0}\\) involves a product of two of the parameters. This nonlinearity makes the OLS, implemented in the R functions lm() and lsfit(), a poor method for obtaining parameter estimates. Instead, we will use the method of maximum likelihood (ML) carried out through such R functions as arima().\nThe function arima() allows us to input the model in its original form, as in Equation 9.6. It then internally rewrites the model to put it in the form of Equation 9.7. (So we do not have to rewrite the model!) It then makes the assumption that the \\(a_t\\) are normal and constructs the multivariate normal likelihood function \\[\nL (Y_{1} , \\dots , Y_{n}; Q ),\n\\] where \\(n\\) is the sample size and \\(Q\\) is the vector of all unknown parameters. In general, for an AR(1) model with \\(k\\) original predictors, we have \\(Q = (\\phi, \\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, \\dots, \\beta_{k}, \\nu^{2})\\). Recall that \\(\\nu^{2} = \\mathrm{var}(a_{t}) = \\mathrm{cov}(a_{t} , a_{t})\\).\nThe function arima() then uses the historical data \\(Y_{1}, \\dots, Y_{n}\\) to find the parameter estimates \\[\n\\hat{Q} = \\left( \\hat{\\phi}, \\hat{\\beta}_{0} , \\hat{\\beta}_{1} , \\dots, \\hat{\\beta}_{k} , \\hat{\\nu}^2 \\right),\n\\] which maximize the likelihood \\(L\\). These estimates (and other things, such as the standard errors of the estimates) can be saved to an output object in R. We will use an example to illustrate the use and interpretation of the function arima().\nMoreover, we can extend the regression model in Equation 9.6 with AR(1) errors to a model with a more general form of errors, ARMA, by assuming \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim \\text{ARMA}(p,q)\\) (see Chapter 6.6 in Brockwell and Davis 2002 and https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/arimax/): \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_t &= \\sum^{k}_{j =1} \\beta_{j} X_{t,j} + \\epsilon_{t},\\\\\n\\epsilon_{t} &= \\phi_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p \\epsilon_{t-p} + \\theta_1 a_{t-1} + \\dots + \\theta_q a_{t-q} + a_t.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{9.9}\\] This model in Equation 9.9 can be specified in R functions arima(), fable::ARIMA(), forecast::Arima(), and forecast::auto.arima().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe R package forecast has been superseded by the new package fable that uses an alternate parameterization of constants, see ?fable::ARIMA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember that the variables \\(Y_t\\) and \\(X_{t,j}\\) (\\(j = 1,\\dots,k\\)) should be detrended prior to the analysis (to avoid spurious regression results, see the previous lecture on dealing with trends in regression). If differencing is chosen as the method of detrending, the orders of differences \\(d\\) and \\(D\\) can be specified directly within the mentioned ARIMA functions (so R will do the differencing for us)."

    "section": "\n9.3 ARIMAX models",
    "text": "9.3 ARIMAX models\nARIMAX (‘X’ stands for ‘external regressor’) models are closely related to Equation 9.9, but there is an important difference. For simplicity of notation, we can present an ARMAX(\\(p,q\\)) model that is a regular ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) model for \\(Y_t\\) plus the external regressors: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_t &= \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p Y_{t-p} + \\theta_1 a_{t-1} + \\dots + \\theta_q a_{t-q} + a_t\\\\\n&+\\sum^{k}_{j =1} \\beta_{j} X_{t,j},\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{9.10}\\] where \\(a_t\\) is still a zero-mean white noise process. Interestingly, at this time there is no convenient way to estimate this model in R. One could manually write lagged values of \\(Y_t\\) as external regressors (i.e., create new variables in R for \\(Y_{t-1},\\dots, Y_{t-p}\\)), use these variables in the R functions mentioned above, but force \\(p=0\\) (e.g., Soliman et al. 2019 used the functions from the R package forecast).\nThe difference between Equation 9.9 and Equation 9.10 is the presence of lagged values of the response variable, \\(Y_t\\), in Equation 9.10. As Hyndman points out, regression coefficients \\(\\beta_j\\) in Equation 9.10 lose their interpretability compared with usual regression and do not show the effect on \\(Y_t\\) when \\(X_t\\) increased by one. Instead, \\(\\beta\\)’s in ARMAX Equation 9.10 are interpreted conditional on the value of previous values of the response variable (https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/arimax/). Therefore, model formulation as in Equation 9.9 may be preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOther applicable models include models with mixed effects such as for repeated measures ANOVA (e.g., implemented in R using nlme::gls() and nlme::lme(), see different correlation structures; without a grouping factor, the results of nlme::lme(..., correlation = corARMA(...)) should be similar to estimating model in Equation 9.9). Other regression functions often borrow the functionality (and syntax) of the package nlme for estimating random effects, so autocorrelated residuals can be incorporated into a generalized additive model, GAM, mgcv::gamm(); generalized additive model for location scale and shape, GAMLSS, gamlss::gamlss(), which also can be used just as GAM, if scale and shape parameters are not modeled. A slightly different solution is possible using a generalized autoregressive moving average model (GARMA) demonstrated in Section 9.4, see gamlss.util::garmaFit().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Golden tilefish ARIMAX\n\n\n\nHere we have time series of 1918–2017 annual landings of golden tilefish (tonne) in the U.S. North Atlantic region and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) index characterizing climatic conditions (Figure 9.1). These time series were described in Nesslage et al. (2021) and Lyubchich and Nesslage (2020). The goal is to develop a regression model to explore the relationship between the landings and AMO.\n\nCodeD <- read.csv(\"./data/tilefish.csv\")\nsummary(D)\n\n#>       Year         Landings         AMO        \n#>  Min.   :1918   Min.   :   5   Min.   :-0.434  \n#>  1st Qu.:1943   1st Qu.: 454   1st Qu.:-0.148  \n#>  Median :1968   Median : 749   Median : 0.014  \n#>  Mean   :1968   Mean   : 952   Mean   : 0.001  \n#>  3rd Qu.:1992   3rd Qu.:1204   3rd Qu.: 0.149  \n#>  Max.   :2017   Max.   :3968   Max.   : 0.358  \n#>                 NA's   :3\n\n\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = Year, y = Landings)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    xlab(\"Year\") +\n    ylab(\"Landings (tonne)\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = Year, y = AMO)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    xlab(\"Year\") +\n    ylab(\"AMO\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Time series plots of the golden tilefish landings and AMO.\n\n\n\n\nInterpolation of missing data (a.k.a. imputation) is a separate and very expansive topic.

    "text": "9.4 GARMA models\nLet \\(Y_t\\) be the observed time series and \\(\\boldsymbol{X_t}\\) exogenous regressors. Then, we can model the conditional distribution of \\(Y_t\\), given \\(Y_1,\\dots,Y_{t-1}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{X_1,\\dots,X_{t}}\\) as \\[\ng(\\mu_t)=\\boldsymbol{X}'_t\\beta+\\sum_{j=1}^p\\phi_j\\{g(Y_{t-j})- \\boldsymbol{X}'_{t-j}\\beta\\}\n+\\sum_{j=1}^q\\theta_j \\{g(Y_{t-j})-g(\\mu_{t-j})\\},\n\\tag{9.11}\\] where \\(g(\\cdot)\\) is an appropriate link function; \\(\\mu_t\\) is a conditional mean of the dependent variable; \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a vector of regression coefficients; \\(\\phi_j\\), \\(j=1,\\dots, p\\), are the autoregressive coefficients; \\(\\theta_j\\), \\(j=1,\\dots,q\\), are the moving average coefficients, while \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the autoregressive and moving average orders, respectively.\nIn certain cases, the function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) requires some transformation of the original series \\(Y_{t-j}\\) to avoid the non-existence of \\(g(Y_{t-j})\\) (Benjamin et al. 2003).\nThe generalized autoregressive moving average model (Equation 9.11), GARMA(\\(p,q\\)), represents a flexible observation-driven modification of the classical Box–Jenkins methodology and GLMs for integer-valued time series. GARMA further advances the classical Gaussian ARMA model to a case where the distribution of the dependent variable is not only non-Gaussian but can be discrete. The dependent variable is assumed to belong to a conditional exponential family distribution given the past information of the process and thus the GARMA can be used to model a variety of discrete distributions (Benjamin et al. 2003). The GARMA model also extends the work of Zeger and Qaqish (1988), who proposed an autoregressive exponential family model, and Li (1994), who introduced its moving average counterpart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Insurance claims GARMA model\n\n\n\nConsider the weekly number of house insurance claims related to water and weather damage in one Canadian city. The number is standardized by the daily number of insured properties in that city. Explore the relationship between the number of claims and weekly total precipitation (mm).\n\nCodeInsurance <- read.csv(\"./data/insurance_weekly.csv\") %>%\n    select(Claims, Precipitation)\nsummary(Insurance)\n\n#>      Claims      Precipitation \n#>  Min.   :  0.0   Min.   : 0.0  \n#>  1st Qu.:  1.0   1st Qu.: 0.8  \n#>  Median :  3.0   Median : 3.8  \n#>  Mean   :  3.6   Mean   : 7.7  \n#>  3rd Qu.:  4.0   3rd Qu.:10.0  \n#>  Max.   :170.0   Max.   :77.3\n\n\n\nCodeInsurance %>%\n    GGally::ggpairs() +\n    theme_light()\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Scatterplot matrix of weekly weather-related home insurance outcomes and precipitation.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the distribution plots in Figure 9.4, the data are highly right-skewed (have heavy right tails). The number of claims is also a discrete variable. Therefore, we deal with non-normal distributions and need to use generalized-type models, like the generalized linear or additive models (GLMs or GAMs). Since there are many zeros in the counts of claims, we can start with the zero-adjusted Poisson distribution to model the number of claims (Gupta et al. 1996; Stasinopoulos and Rigby 2007).\nIn our case, there is just a slight chance that past-week precipitation affects the current-week insurance claims. Hence, we will still keep the current precipitation and additionally explore the lagged effects, using the cross-correlation function (Figure 9.5).\n\nCodepar(mar = c(4, 5, 1, 1) + 0.1, mgp = c(3, 1, 0), mfrow = c(1, 1))\nlogconstant <- 1\nwith(Insurance,\n     ccf(log(Claims + logconstant), Precipitation, las = 1, lag.max = 3)\n)\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Estimated cross-correlation function (CCF) of time series of the number of home insurance claims and precipitation.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the estimated CCFs (Figure 9.5), past-week precipitation is significantly correlated with the current-week number of claims, so we can add the lagged predictor into our models.\n\nCodeInsurance <- Insurance %>%\n    mutate(Precipitation_lag1 = dplyr::lag(Precipitation, 1),\n           Week = 1:nrow(Insurance),\n           Claims_ln = log(Claims + logconstant))\n\n\nBased on Figure 9.6, there might be an increasing trend in the number of claims that we might be able to approximate with a linear function.\n\nCodep1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(as.ts(log(Insurance$Claims + logconstant))) +\n    xlab(\"Week\") +\n    ylab(\"ln(Number of claims)\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(as.ts(log(Insurance$Claims + logconstant)),\n                      lag.max = 110) +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (weeks)\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Time series plot and sample ACF of the weekly number of claims in a city, after the ln transformation.\n\n\n\n\nPlot the data once again after the transformations (Figure 9.7).\n\nCodeInsurance %>%\n    dplyr::select(-Claims) %>%\n    GGally::ggpairs() +\n    theme_light()\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Scatterplot matrix of the weekly number of weather-related home insurance claims and precipitation.\n\n\n\n\nFit a GARMA model relating the weekly number of insurance claims to the total precipitation during that and previous weeks.\n\n# The model function doesn't accept NAs, so remove them\nInsurance_noNA <- na.omit(Insurance)\n\nlibrary(gamlss.util)\nm00zip <- garmaFit(Claims ~ Precipitation + Week + Precipitation_lag1\n                   ,family = ZIP\n                   ,data = Insurance_noNA)\n\n#> deviance of linear model=  3014\n\n\nObtain ACF and PACF plots of the model residuals to select ARMA order (Figure 9.8).\n\nCodep1 <- forecast::ggAcf(m00zip$residuals) +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (weeks)\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(m00zip$residuals, type = \"partial\") +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (weeks)\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: ACF and PACF plots of residuals of the base model GARMA(0,0) based on ZIP distribution.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the observed ACF and PACF patterns in Figure 9.8, an appropriate model for the temporal dependence could be ARMA(3,0).

    "section": "\n9.5 Granger causality",
    "text": "9.5 Granger causality\nThe Granger causality (Granger 1969; Kirchgässner and Wolters 2007) concept is based on predictability, which is why we should consider it in the time series course. Pearl causality is based on the analysis of interventions (Rebane and Pearl 1987; Pearl 2009).\nLet \\(I_t\\) be the total information set available at the time \\(t\\). This information set includes the two time series \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Let \\(\\bar{X}_t\\) be the set of all current and past values of \\(X\\), i.e., \\(\\bar{X}_t = \\{X_{t}, X_{t-1}, \\dots, X_{t-k}, \\dots \\}\\) and analogously of \\(Y\\). Let \\(\\sigma^2(\\cdot)\\) be the variance of the corresponding forecast error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDifference of two sets, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), is denoted by \\(A \\setminus B\\); but sometimes the minus sign is used, \\(A - B\\).\n\n\nGranger causality\n\\(X\\) is (simply) Granger causal to \\(Y\\) if future values of \\(Y\\) can be predicted better, i.e., with a smaller forecast error variance, if current and past values of \\(X\\) are used: \\[\n\\sigma^2(Y_{t+1}|I_t) < \\sigma^2(Y_{t+1}|I_t \\setminus \\bar{X}_t).\n\\tag{9.12}\\]\nInstantaneous Granger causality\n\\(X\\) is instantaneously Granger causal to \\(Y\\) if the future value of \\(Y\\), \\(Y_{t+1}\\), can be predicted better, i.e., with a smaller forecast error variance, if the future value of \\(X\\), \\(X_{t+1}\\), is used in addition to the current and past values of \\(X\\): \\[\n\\sigma^2(Y_{t+1}|\\{I_t, X_{t+1}\\}) < \\sigma^2(Y_{t+1}|I_t ).\n\\tag{9.13}\\]\nFeedback\nThere is feedback between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) if \\(X\\) is causal to \\(Y\\) and \\(Y\\) is causal to \\(X\\). Feedback is only defined for the case of simple causal relations.\nThe test for Equation 9.12 and Equation 9.13 is, essentially, an \\(F\\)-test comparing two nested models: with additional predictors \\(X\\) and without. In other words, consider the model: \\[\nY_t = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{k_1}\\beta_k Y_{t-k} + \\sum_{k=k_0}^{k_2}\\alpha_k X_{t-k} + U_t\n\\tag{9.14}\\] with \\(k_0 = 1\\). An \\(F\\)-test is applied to test the null hypothesis, H\\(_0\\): \\(\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = \\dots = \\alpha_{k_2} = 0\\). By switching \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in Equation 9.14, it can be tested whether a simple causal relation from \\(Y\\) to \\(X\\) exists. There is a feedback relation if the null hypothesis is rejected in both directions (\\(X\\rightarrow Y\\) and \\(Y\\rightarrow X\\)). To test whether there is an instantaneous causality, we finally set \\(k_0 = 0\\) and perform a \\(t\\) or \\(F\\)-test for the null hypothesis H\\(_0\\): \\(\\alpha_0 = 0\\).\nThe problem with this test is that the results are strongly dependent on the number of lags of the explanatory variable, \\(k_2\\). There is a trade-off: the more lagged values we include, the better the influence of this variable can be captured. This argues for a high maximal lag. On the other hand, the power of this test is lower the more lagged values are included (Chapter 3 of Kirchgässner and Wolters 2007). Two general procedures can be used to select the lags: inspecting the sensitivity of results to different \\(k_2\\) (sensitivity analysis) or one of the different information criteria guiding model selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Insurance claims and precipitation Granger causality test\n\n\n\nFor example, use the insurance data to test the relationships between the log-transformed home insurance number of claims and precipitation. A quick test has been performed to check that the time series are stationary and do not have a strong seasonality, so the chance of detecting spurious relationships is minimized. We can use the series in Equation 9.14.\n\nlmtest::grangertest(Claims_ln ~ Precipitation \n                    ,order = 1\n                    ,data = Insurance_noNA)\n\n#> Granger causality test\n#> \n#> Model 1: Claims_ln ~ Lags(Claims_ln, 1:1) + Lags(Precipitation, 1:1)\n#> Model 2: Claims_ln ~ Lags(Claims_ln, 1:1)\n#>   Res.Df Df    F Pr(>F)   \n#> 1    515                  \n#> 2    516 -1 10.5 0.0013 **\n#> ---\n#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe low \\(p\\)-value shows that precipitation is a Granger cause of the number of home insurance claims. Now test the reverse relationship.\n\nlmtest::grangertest(Precipitation ~ Claims_ln  \n                    ,order = 1\n                    ,data = Insurance_noNA)\n\n#> Granger causality test\n#> \n#> Model 1: Precipitation ~ Lags(Precipitation, 1:1) + Lags(Claims_ln, 1:1)\n#> Model 2: Precipitation ~ Lags(Precipitation, 1:1)\n#>   Res.Df Df   F Pr(>F)\n#> 1    515              \n#> 2    516 -1 0.2   0.65\n\n\nReverse testing does not confirm a statistically significant Granger causality. Hence, we do not have enough evidence to claim that insurance claims are a Granger cause of precipitation (we could expect to come to this conclusion based on our knowledge of how things work), and hence there is no evidence of feedback between losses and precipitation.\nThe function lmtest::grangertest() does not allow us to set order = 0 (to test instantaneous Granger causality), but we can do it manually. First, to show that ‘manual’ results match the lmtest::grangertest() output, repeat the test above using two nested models with lag 1.\n\nM1 <- lm(Claims_ln ~ dplyr::lag(Claims_ln, 1) + dplyr::lag(Precipitation, 1)\n         ,data = Insurance_noNA)\nM2 <- lm(Claims_ln ~ dplyr::lag(Claims_ln, 1)\n         ,data = Insurance_noNA)\nanova(M1, M2)\n\n#> Analysis of Variance Table\n#> \n#> Model 1: Claims_ln ~ dplyr::lag(Claims_ln, 1) + dplyr::lag(Precipitation, \n#>     1)\n#> Model 2: Claims_ln ~ dplyr::lag(Claims_ln, 1)\n#>   Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq    F Pr(>F)   \n#> 1    515 211                            \n#> 2    516 215 -1     -4.32 10.5 0.0013 **\n#> ---\n#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe results match.\nSecond, test the instantaneous Granger causality in the same manner.\n\nM3 <- lm(Claims_ln ~ dplyr::lag(Claims_ln, 1) + dplyr::lag(Precipitation, 1) + \n             Precipitation, data = Insurance_noNA)\nM4 <- lm(Claims_ln ~ dplyr::lag(Claims_ln, 1) + dplyr::lag(Precipitation, 1)\n         ,data = Insurance_noNA)\nanova(M3, M4)\n\n#> Analysis of Variance Table\n#> \n#> Model 1: Claims_ln ~ dplyr::lag(Claims_ln, 1) + dplyr::lag(Precipitation, \n#>     1) + Precipitation\n#> Model 2: Claims_ln ~ dplyr::lag(Claims_ln, 1) + dplyr::lag(Precipitation, \n#>     1)\n#>   Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq  F  Pr(>F)    \n#> 1    514 203                            \n#> 2    515 211 -1     -7.91 20 9.5e-06 ***\n#> ---\n#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe results show the presence of such causality.\nAs an extension to the demonstrated techniques for testing Granger causality, we may consider more complex generalized and additive models, to relax the assumptions of normality and linearity in the modeling process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe lmtest::grangertest() options set one value to both \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) in Equation 9.14. In our example, it was \\(k_1 = k_2 = 1\\). The ‘manual’ test using the function anova() can be used for models with \\(k_1 = k_2\\) or \\(k_1 \\neq k_2\\)."

    "text": "9.6 About predictions\nLet \\(\\hat{Y}_T(h)\\) be a forecast \\(h\\) steps ahead made at the time \\(T\\). If \\(\\hat{Y}_T(h)\\) only uses information up to time \\(T\\), the resulting forecasts are called out-of-sample forecasts. Economists call them ex-ante forecasts. We have discussed several ways to select the optimal method or model for forecasting, e.g., using PMAE, PMSE, or coverage – all calculated on a testing set. Chatfield (2000) mentions several ways to unfairly ‘improve’ forecasts:\n\nFitting the model to all the data including the test set.\nFitting several models to the training set and choosing the model which gives the best ‘forecasts’ of the test set. The selected model is then used (again) to produce forecasts of the test set, even though the latter has already been used in the modeling process.\nUsing the known test-set values of ‘future’ observations on the explanatory variables in multivariate forecasting. This will improve forecasts of the dependent variable in the test set, but these future values will not of course be known at the time the forecast is supposedly made (though in practice the ‘forecast’ is made at a later date). Economists call such forecasts ex-post forecasts to distinguish them from ex-ante forecasts. The latter, being genuinely out-of-sample, use forecasts of future values of explanatory variables, where necessary, to compute forecasts of the response variable. Ex-post forecasts can be useful for assessing the effects of explanatory variables, provided the analyst does not pretend that they are genuine out-of-sample forecasts.\n\nSo what to do if we put lots of effort to build a regression model using time series and need to forecast the response, \\(Y_t\\), which is modeled using different independent variables \\(X_{t,k}\\) (\\(k=1,\\dots,K\\))? Two options are possible.\nLeading indicators\nIf \\(X_{t,k}\\)’s are leading indicators with lags starting at \\(l\\), we, generally, would not need their future values to obtain the forecasts \\(\\hat{Y}_T(h)\\), where \\(h\\leqslant l\\). For example, the model for losses tested in Section 9.5 shows that precipitation with lag 1 is a good predictor for current losses, i.e., precipitation is a leading indicator. The 1-week ahead forecast of \\(Y_{t+1}\\) can be obtained using the current precipitation \\(X_t\\) (all data are available). If \\(h>l\\), we will be forced to forecast the independent variables, \\(X_{t,k}\\)’s – see the next option.\nForecast of predictors\nIf we opt for forecasting \\(X_{t,k}\\)’s, the errors (uncertainty) of such forecasts will be larger, because future \\(X_{t,k}\\)’s themselves will be the estimates. Nevertheless, it might be the only choice when leading indicators are not available. Building a full and comprehensive model with all diagnostics for each regressor is usually unfeasible and even problematic if we plan to consider multivariate models for regressors (the complexity of models will quickly escalate). As an alternative, it is common to use automatic or semi-automatic univariate procedures that can help to forecast each of the \\(X_{t,k}\\)’s. For example, consider exponential smoothing, Holt–Winters smoothing, and auto-selected SARIMA/ARIMA/ARMA/AR/MA models – all those can be automated for a large number of forecasts to make."

Many observed time series exhibit nonlinear characteristics, but nonlinear models often fail to give better out-of-sample forecasts than linear models, perhaps because the latter are more robust to departures from model assumptions.

Without loss of generality, we assume \\(0 \\leqslant \\omega \\leqslant \\pi\\). In fact, for discrete data, frequencies outside this range are aliased into this range. For example, suppose that \\(-\\pi < (\\omega = \\pi - \\delta) < 0\\), then \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\cos(\\omega t) &= \\cos((\\pi - \\delta)t) \\\\\n& = \\cos(\\pi t) \\cos(\\delta t) + \\sin(\\pi t) \\sin(\\delta t) \\\\\n& = \\cos(\\delta t).\n\\end{split}\n\\] Hence, a sampled sinusoid with a frequency smaller than 0 appears to coincide with a sinusoid with frequency in the interval \\([0, \\pi]\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe term \\(A\\cos \\omega t + B \\sin \\omega t\\) is a periodic function with the period \\(2\\pi / \\omega\\). The period \\(2\\pi / \\omega\\) represents the number of time units that it takes for the function to take the same value again, i.e., to complete a cycle. The frequency, measured in cycles per time unit, is given by the inverse \\(\\omega / (2 \\pi)\\). The angular frequency, measured in radians per time unit, is given by \\(\\omega\\). Because of its convenience, the angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) will be used to describe the periodicity of the function, and its name is shortened to frequency when there is no danger of confusion.\n\n\nConsider monthly data that exhibit a 12-month seasonality. Hence, the period \\(2\\pi / \\omega = 12\\), which implies the angular frequency \\(\\omega = \\pi / 6\\). The frequency, measured in cycles per time unit, is given by the inverse \\[\n\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.08.\n\\]\nThe formulas to estimate parameters of regression in Equation 10.1 take a much simpler form if \\(\\omega\\) is one of the Fourier frequencies, defined by \\[\n\\omega_j=\\frac{2\\pi j}{T}, \\quad  j=0,\\dots, \\frac{T}{2},\n\\] then \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{A}&=\\frac{2}{T}\\sum_t Y_t\\cos \\omega_jt,\\\\\n\\hat{B}&=\\frac{2}{T}\\sum_t Y_t\\sin \\omega_jt,\\\\\n\\hat{C}&=\\overline{Y}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_tY_t.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nA suitable way of testing the significance of the sinusoidal component with frequency \\(\\omega_j\\) is using its contribution to the sum of squares \\[\nR_T(\\omega_j)=\\frac{T}{2}\\left( \\hat{A}^2+\\hat{B}^2 \\right).\n\\] If the \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\), then it follows that \\(\\hat{A}\\) and \\(\\hat{B}\\) are also independent normal, each with the variance \\(2\\sigma^2/T\\), so under the null hypothesis of \\(A = B = 0\\) we find that \\[\\frac{R_T(\\omega_j)}{\\sigma^2}\\sim \\chi_2^2\\] or equivalently that \\(R_T(\\omega_j)/(2\\sigma^2)\\) has an exponential distribution with mean 1. The above theory can be extended to the simultaneous estimation of several periodic components."

    "section": "\n10.4 Smoothing",
    "text": "10.4 Smoothing\nThe idea behind smoothing is to take weighted averages over neighboring frequencies to reduce the variability associated with individual periodogram values. However, such an operation necessarily introduces some bias into the estimation procedure. Theoretical studies focus on the amount of smoothing that is required to obtain an optimum trade-off between bias and variance. In practice, this usually means that the choice of a kernel and amount of smoothing is somewhat subjective.\nThe main form of a smoothed estimator is given by \\[\n\\hat{f}(\\lambda) = \\int^{\\pi}_{-\\pi}\\frac{1}{h}K\\left( \\frac{\\omega-\\lambda}{h}\\right)I_T(\\omega)d\\omega,\n\\] where \\(I_T(\\cdot)\\) is the periodogram based on \\(T\\) observations, \\(K(\\cdot)\\) is a kernel function, and \\(h\\) is the bandwidth. We usually take \\(K(\\cdot)\\) to be a nonnegative function, symmetric about 0 and integrating to 1. Thus, any symmetric density, such as the normal density, will work. In practice, however, it is more usual to take a kernel of finite range, such as the Epanechnikov kernel \\[\nK(x)=\\frac{3}{4\\sqrt{5}}\\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{5} \\right), \\quad -\\sqrt{5}\\leqslant x \\leqslant \\sqrt{5},\n\\] which is 0 outside the interval \\([-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}]\\). This choice of kernel function has some optimality properties. However, in practice, this optimality is less important than the choice of bandwidth \\(h\\), which effectively controls the range over which the periodogram is smoothed.\nThere are some additional difficulties with the performance of the sample periodogram in the presence of a sinusoidal variation whose frequency is not one of the Fourier frequencies. This effect is known as leakage. The reason of leakage is that we always consider a truncated periodogram. Truncation implicitly assumes that the time series is periodic with a period \\(T\\), which, of course, is not always true. So we artificially introduce non-existent periodicities into the estimated spectrum, i.e., cause ‘leakage’ of the spectrum. (If the time series is perfectly periodic over \\(T\\) then there is no leakage.) The leakage can be treated using an operation of tapering on the periodogram, i.e., by choosing appropriate periodogram windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen we work with periodograms, we lose all phase (relative location/time origin) information: the periodogram will be the same if all the data were circularly rotated to a new time origin, i.e., the observed data are treated as perfectly periodic.\n\n\nAnother popular choice to smooth a periodogram is the Daniell kernel (with parameter \\(m\\)). For a time series, it is a centered moving average of values between the times \\(t - m\\) and \\(t + m\\) (inclusive). For example, the smoothing formula for a Daniell kernel with \\(m = 2\\) is \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{x}_t &= \\frac{x_{t-2}+x_{t-1}+x_t + x_{t+1}+x_{t+2}}{5} \\\\\n&= 0.2x_{t-2} + 0.2x_{t-1} +0.2x_t + 0.2x_{t+1} +0.2x_{t+2}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe weighting coefficients for a Daniell kernel with \\(m = 2\\) can be checked using the function kernel(). In the output, the indices in coef[ ] refer to the time difference from the center of the average at the time \\(t\\).\n\nkernel(\"daniell\", m = 2)\n\n#> Daniell(2) \n#> coef[-2] = 0.2\n#> coef[-1] = 0.2\n#> coef[ 0] = 0.2\n#> coef[ 1] = 0.2\n#> coef[ 2] = 0.2\n\n\nThe modified Daniell kernel is such that the two endpoints in the averaging receive half the weight that the interior points do. For a modified Daniell kernel with \\(m = 2\\), the smoothing is \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{x}_t &= \\frac{x_{t-2}+2x_{t-1}+2x_t + 2x_{t+1} + x_{t+2}}{8} \\\\\n& = 0.125x_{t-2} +0.25x_{t-1}+0.25x_t+0.25x_{t+1}+0.125x_{t+2}\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nList the weighting coefficients:\n\nkernel(\"modified.daniell\", m = 2)\n\n#> mDaniell(2) \n#> coef[-2] = 0.125\n#> coef[-1] = 0.250\n#> coef[ 0] = 0.250\n#> coef[ 1] = 0.250\n#> coef[ 2] = 0.125\n\n\nEither the Daniell kernel or the modified Daniell kernel can be convoluted (repeated) so that the smoothing is applied again to the smoothed values. This produces a more extensive smoothing by averaging over a wider time interval. For instance, to repeat a Daniell kernel with \\(m = 2\\) on the smoothed values that resulted from a Daniell kernel with \\(m = 2\\), the formula would be \\[\n\\hat{\\hat{x}}_t = \\frac{\\hat{x}_{t-2}+\\hat{x}_{t-1}+\\hat{x}_t +\\hat{x}_{t+1}+\\hat{x}_{t+2}}{5}.\n\\]\nThe weights for averaging the original data for convoluted Daniell kernels with \\(m = 2\\) in both smooths will be\n\nkernel(\"daniell\", m = c(2, 2))\n\n#> Daniell(2,2) \n#> coef[-4] = 0.04\n#> coef[-3] = 0.08\n#> coef[-2] = 0.12\n#> coef[-1] = 0.16\n#> coef[ 0] = 0.20\n#> coef[ 1] = 0.16\n#> coef[ 2] = 0.12\n#> coef[ 3] = 0.08\n#> coef[ 4] = 0.04\n\nkernel(\"modified.daniell\", m = c(2, 2))\n\n#> mDaniell(2,2) \n#> coef[-4] = 0.0156\n#> coef[-3] = 0.0625\n#> coef[-2] = 0.1250\n#> coef[-1] = 0.1875\n#> coef[ 0] = 0.2188\n#> coef[ 1] = 0.1875\n#> coef[ 2] = 0.1250\n#> coef[ 3] = 0.0625\n#> coef[ 4] = 0.0156\n\n\nThe center values are weighted slightly more heavily in the modified Daniell kernel than in the unmodified one.\nWhen we smooth a periodogram, we are smoothing across frequencies rather than across times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Spectral analysis of the airline passenger data\n\n\n\nRecall the airline passenger time series (Figure 3.12) that has an increasing trend and strong multiplicative seasonality.\nThe series should be detrended before a spectral analysis.

For example, in monthly data with annual seasonality (period of 12 months), we often observe peaks at 6, 4, and 3 months. This is exactly the pattern that we see in the figures above.\nWe can also approximate our data with an AR model and then plot the approximating periodogram of the AR model (Figure 10.3).\n\nCodespectrum(res, method = \"ar\")\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Periodogram of AR process approximating the monthly log-transformed and detrended AirPassengers time series."

    "text": "10.6 Frequency estimation in time\nThe assumption of a whole time series having a constant spectrum might be very limiting for the analysis of long time series. An estimation of frequencies locally in time allows us to study how the spectrum changes in time, and also detect smaller (short-lived) signals that would be averaged out otherwise. A straightforward solution is to separate the time series into windows (sub-periods) and estimate a spectrum in each such window.\nThe windowed analysis makes sense when in each window we have enough observations to estimate the frequencies. As a guide, we should have at least two observations per period to be able to represent the signal in the discrete Fourier transform. For example, we cannot estimate the seasonality if we sample once per year – this is our sampling rate or sampling frequency \\(F_s\\). To start identifying seasonal periodicity, our sampling rate should be at least 2 samples per year. The highest frequency we can work with is limited by the Nyquist frequency \\[\nF_N = \\frac{F_s}{2},\n\\] which is half of the sampling frequency.\nAfter applying the FFT in each window, the results can be visualized in a spectrogram. The spectrogram combines information from multiple periodograms: it shows time on the \\(x\\)-axis, frequency on the \\(y\\)-axis, and the corresponding spectrum power as the color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Spectrograms for the NAO\n\n\n\nConsider a long time series of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index obtained from an ensemble of 100 model-constrained NAO reconstructions (Figure 10.7).\n\nCodeNAOdf <- readr::read_csv(\"./data/NAO.csv\", skip = 12, show_col_types = FALSE) %>% \n    rename(NAOproxy = nao_mc_mean) %>% \n    select(Year, NAOproxy) %>% \n    arrange(Year)\nNAO <- ts(NAOdf$NAOproxy, start = NAOdf$Year[1])\nspec_raw <- spec.pgram(NAO, detrend = FALSE, plot = FALSE, spans = 3)\n\n# Find the frequency with the max power\nfmax <- spec_raw$freq[which.max(spec_raw$spec)]\n\n\n\nCodep1 <- forecast::autoplot(NAO) +\n    xlab(\"Year\") +\n    ylab(\"NAO\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- data.frame(Spectrum = spec_raw$spec, \n                 Frequency = spec_raw$freq) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = Spectrum)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log10') +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = fmax, col = \"blue\", lty = 2) + \n    geom_line() + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- data.frame(Spectrum = spec_raw$spec, \n                 Period = 1/spec_raw$freq) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = Period, y = Spectrum)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log10') +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 1/fmax, col = \"blue\", lty = 2) +\n    geom_line() + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 / (p2 + p3) + \n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter index (December, January, and February) calculated as the mean of 100 model-constrained NAO reconstructions, along with its smoothed periodograms.

From the global FFT results, the frequency with the maximal power is 0.019 year\\(^{-1}\\), which is equivalent to the period of about 53.3 years. We will set the window for the FFT and calculate the spectrogram.

Beware that aperiodic but autoregressive processes produce peaks in spectral densities. Harmonic analysis is a complicated art rather than a straightforward procedure.\nIt is extremely difficult to derive the significance of a weak periodicity from harmonic analysis. Do not believe analytical estimates (e.g., exponential probability), as they rarely apply to real data. It is essential to make simulations, typically permuting or bootstrapping the data keeping the observing times fixed. Simulations of the final model with the observation times are also advised."

Differencing too many times causes problems.\nAutocorrelation in observations affects results of the \\(t\\)-test and Mann–Kendall test.\nThe Mann–Kendall test focuses on a more general class of trends than the \\(t\\)-test does.\nThe null hypothesis of the augmented Dickey–Fuller test is no unit root (stationarity).\nARIMA\\((p,d,q)\\) is a difference-stationary process.\nBootstrapping allows us to replicate the finite-sample distribution of the test statistic.\nTo detrend a time series, the difference operator should be applied with the same lag(s) at which the sample ACF has statistically significant values.\nOne of the correct ways to run regression on the time series \\(Y_t\\) and \\(X_t\\) with trends is to detrend these time series before fitting the regression model.\nIn practice, it is seldom necessary to go beyond second-order differences for detrending a time series."
